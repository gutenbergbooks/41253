<h2>PREFACE TO VOLUME THIRD.</h2>


<p>A spirit of examination and inquiry is in our days continually
urging the literary men of France, Switzerland,
Germany, and England to search after the original documents
which form the basis of Modern History. I desire to add
my mite to the accomplishment of the important task which
our age appears to have undertaken. Hitherto I have not
been content simply with reading the works of contemporary
historians: I have examined eye-witnesses, letters, and
original narratives; and have made use of some manuscripts,
particularly that of Bullinger, which has been printed since
the appearance of the Second Volume of this Work in
France.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>But the necessity of having recourse to unpublished documents
became more urgent when I approached (as I do in
the Twelfth Book) the history of the Reformation in France.
On this subject we possess but few printed memoirs, in consequence
of the perpetual trials in which the Reformed
Church of that country has existed. In the spring of 1838
I examined, as far as was in my power, the manuscripts
preserved in the public libraries of Paris, and it will be seen
that a manuscript in the Royal Library, hitherto I believe
unknown, throws much light on the early stages of the Reformation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
and in the autumn of 1839 I consulted the manuscripts
in the library belonging to the consistory of the pastors
of Neufchatel, a collection exceedingly rich with regard to this
period, as having inherited the manuscripts of Farel's library;
and through the kindness of the Chatelain of Meuron I
obtained the use of a manuscript life of Farel written by
Choupard, into which most of these documents have been
copied. These materials have enabled me to reconstruct an
entire phasis of the Reformation in France. In addition to
these aids, and those supplied by the Library of Geneva, I
made an appeal, in the columns of the <i>Archives du Christianisme</i>,
to all friends of history and the Reformation who
might have any manuscripts at their disposal; and I here
gratefully acknowledge the different communications that
have been made to me, in particular by M. Ladevèze, pastor
at Meaux. But although religious wars and persecutions
have destroyed many precious documents, a number still
exist, no doubt, in various parts of France, which would
be of vast importance for the history of the Reformation;
and I earnestly call upon all those who may possess or have
any knowledge of them, kindly to communicate with me on
the subject. It is felt now-a-days that these documents are
common property; and on this account I hope my appeal
will not be made in vain.</p>

<p>It may be thought that in writing a general History of
the Reformation, I have entered into an unnecessary detail
of its first dawnings in France. But these particulars are
almost unknown, the events that form the subject of my
Twelfth Book, occupying only four pages in the <i>Histoire
Ecclesiastique des Eglises réformées au Royaume de France</i>,
by Theodore Beza; and other historians have confined themselves
almost entirely to the political progress of the nation.
Unquestionably the scenes that I have discovered, and
which I am now about to relate, are not so imposing as the
Diet of Worms. Nevertheless, independently of the christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
interest that is attached to them, the humble but
heaven-descended movement that I have endeavoured to
describe, has probably exerted a greater influence over the
destinies of France than the celebrated wars of Francis I.
and Charles V. In a large machine, not that which makes
the greatest show is always the most essential part, but
the most hidden springs.</p>

<p>Complaints have been made of the delay that has taken
place in the publication of this third volume; and some
persons would have had me keep back the first until the
whole was completed. There are, possibly, certain superior
intellects to which conditions may be prescribed; but there
are others whose weakness must give them, and to this
number the author belongs. To publish a volume at one
time, and then a second whenever I was able, and after that
a third, is the course that my important duties and my poor
ability allow me to take. Other circumstances, moreover,
have interposed; severe afflictions have on two occasions
interrupted the composition of this third volume, and
gathered all my affections and all my thoughts over the
graves of beloved children. The reflection that it was my
duty to glorify that adorable Master who addressed me in
such powerful appeals, and who vouchsafed me such Divine
consolation, could alone have given me the courage required
for the completion of my task.</p>

<p>I thought these explanations were due to the kindness
with which this Work has been received both in France and
England, and especially in the latter country. The approbation
of the Protestant Christians of Great Britain, the representatives
of evangelical principles and doctrines in the
most distant parts of the world, is most highly valued by
me; and I feel a pleasure in telling them that it is a most
precious encouragement to my labours.</p>

<p>The cause of truth recompenses those who embrace and
defend it, and such has been the result with the nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
who received the Reformation. In the eighteenth century,
at the very moment when Rome thought to triumph by
the Jesuits and the scaffold, the victory slipped from her
grasp. Rome fell, like Naples, Portugal, and Spain, into
inextricable difficulties; and at the same time two Protestant
nations arose and began to exercise an influence over
Europe that had hitherto belonged to the Roman-catholic
powers. England came forth victorious from those attacks
of the French and Spaniards which the pope had so long
been stirring up against her, and the Elector of Brandenburg,
in spite of the wrath of Clement XI., encircled his
head with a kingly crown. Since that time England has
extended her dominion in every quarter of the globe, and
Prussia has taken a new rank among the continental states,
while a third power, Russia, also separated from Rome,
has been growing up in her immense deserts. In this
manner have evangelical principles exerted their influence
over the countries that have embraced them, and <i>righteousness
hath exalted the nations</i> (Prov. xiv. 34). Let the
evangelical nations be well assured that to Protestantism
they are indebted for their greatness. From the moment
they abandon the position that God has given them, and
incline again towards Rome, they will lose their glory and
their power. Rome is now endeavouring to win them over,
employing flattery and threats by turns; she would, like
Delilah, lull them to sleep upon her knees,......but it would
be to cut off their locks, that their adversaries might put
out their eyes and bind them with fetters of brass.</p>

<p>Here, too, is a great lesson for that France with which the
author feels himself so intimately connected by the ties of
ancestry. Should France, imitating her different governments,
turn again towards the papacy, it will be, in our belief,
the signal of great disasters. Whoever attaches himself to
the papacy will be compromised in its destruction. France
has no prospect of strength or of greatness but by turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
towards the Gospel. May this great truth be rightly understood
by the people and their leaders!</p>

<p>It is true that in our days popery is making a great
stir. Although labouring under an incurable consumption,
she would by a hectic flush and feverish activity persuade
others and herself too that she is still in full vigour. This
a theologian in Turin has endeavoured to do in a work
occasioned by this History, and in which we are ready to
acknowledge a certain talent in bringing forward testimonies,
even the most feeble, with a tone of candour to which we are
little accustomed, and in a becoming style, with the exception,
however, of the culpable facility with which the author in
his twelfth chapter revives accusations against the reformers,
the falsehood of which has been so authentically demonstrated
and so fully acknowledged.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>As a sequel to his Biography of Luther, M. Audin has
recently published a Life of Calvin, written under the influence
of lamentable prejudices, and in which we can hardly
recognise the reformers and the Reformation. Nevertheless,
we do not find in this author the shameful charges against
Calvin to which we have just alluded; he has passed them
over in praiseworthy silence. No man that has any self-respect
can now venture to bring forward these gross and
foolish calumnies.</p>

<p>Perhaps on some other occasion we shall add a few words
to what we have already said in our First Book on the origin
of popery. They would here be out of place.</p>

<p>I shall only remark, in a general way, that it is precisely
the <i>human</i> and very rational causes that so clearly explain
its origin, to which the papacy has recourse to prove its
<i>divine</i> institution. Thus christian antiquity declares that
the universal episcopacy was committed to all the bishops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
so that the bishops of Jerusalem, Alexandria, Antioch,
Ephesus, Rome, Carthage, Lyons, Arles, Milan, Hippo,
Cæsarea, &amp;c., were interested and interfered in all that took
place in the christian world. Rome immediately claims for
herself that duty which was incumbent on all, and reasoning
as if no one but herself were concerned in it, employs it to
demonstrate her primacy.</p>

<p>Let us take another example. The christian churches,
established in the large cities of the empire, sent missionaries
to the countries with which they were connected. This was
done first of all by Jerusalem; then by Antioch, Alexandria,
and Ephesus; afterwards by Rome: and Rome forthwith
concludes from what she had done after the others, and to a
less extent than the others, that she was entitled to set herself
above the others. These examples will suffice.</p>

<p>Let us only remark further, that Rome possessed alone in
the West the honour that had been shared in the East by
Corinth, Philippi, Thessalonica, Ephesus, Antioch, and in a
much higher degree by Jerusalem;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> namely, that of having
one apostle or many among its first teachers. Accordingly,
the Latin Churches must naturally have felt a certain respect
towards Rome. But the Eastern Christians, who respected
her as the Church of the political metropolis of the empire,
would never acknowledge her ecclesiastical superiority.
The famous General Council of Chalcedon ascribed to Constantinople,
formerly the obscure Byzantium, the same privileges
(&#964;&#945; &#953;&#963;&#945; &#960;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#946;&#949;&#953;&#945;) as to Rome, and declared that she
ought to be elevated <i>like her</i>. And hence when the papacy
was definitively formed in Rome, the East would not acknowledge
a master of whom it had never heard mention;
and, standing on the ancient footing of its catholicity, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
abandoned the West to the power of the new sect which
had sprung up in its bosom. The East even to this day
calls herself emphatically catholic and orthodox; and whenever
you ask one of the Eastern Christians, whom Rome
has gained by her numerous concessions, whether he is a
catholic? "No," replies he directly, "I am papistian (a
papist)."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>If this History has been criticized by the Romish party, it
seems also to have met with others who have regarded it
in a purely literary light. Men for whom I feel much
esteem appear to attach greater importance to a literary or
political history of the Reformation, than to an exposition
grounded on its spiritual principles and its interior springs of
action. I can well understand this way of viewing my subject,
but I cannot participate in it. In my opinion, the very
essence of the Reformation is its doctrines and its inward
life. Every work in which these two things do not hold
the chief place may be showy, but it will not be faithfully
and candidly historical. It would be like a philosopher who,
in describing a man, should detail with great accuracy and
picturesque beauty all that concerns his body, but should
give only a subordinate place to that divine inhabitant, the
soul.</p>

<p>There are no doubt great defects in the feeble work of
which I here present another fragment to the christian public;
and I should desire that it were still more copiously imbued
with the spirit of the Reformation. The better I have succeeded
in pointing out whatever manifests the glory of Christ,
the more faithful I shall have been to history. I willingly
adopt as my law those words, which an historian of the sixteenth
century, a man of the sword still more than of the pen,
after writing a portion of the history of that Protestantism in
France which I do not purpose narrating, addresses to those
who might think of completing his task: "I would give them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
that law which I acknowledge myself: that, in seeking the
glory of this precious instrument, their principal aim should
be that of the arm which has prepared, employed, and wielded
it at His good pleasure. For all praise given to princes is
unseasonable and misplaced, if it has not for leaf and root that
of the living God, to whom alone belong honour and dominion
for ever and ever."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<h2>HISTORY OF THE REFORMATION.</h2>

<h3>BOOK IX.<br />

FIRST REFORMS. 1521 AND 1522.</h3>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Progress of the Reformation&mdash;New Period&mdash;Usefulness of Luther's Captivity
in the Wartburg&mdash;Agitation in Germany&mdash;Melancthon and
Luther&mdash;Enthusiasm.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">PROGRESS OF THE REFORMATION.</div>

<p>For four years an old doctrine had been again proclaimed in
the Church. The great tidings of <i>salvation by grace</i>, published
in earlier times in Asia, Greece, and Italy, by Paul and his
brethren, and after many ages re-discovered in the Bible by a
monk of Wittemberg, had resounded from the plains of Saxony
as far as Rome, Paris, and London; and the lofty mountains
of Switzerland had re-echoed its powerful accents. The
springs of truth, of liberty, and of life, had been re-opened to
the human race. Thither had the nations hastened in crowds,
and drunk gladly; but those who had there so eagerly
quenched their thirst, were unchanged in appearance. All
within was new, and yet everything <i>without</i> seemed to have
remained the same.</p>

<p>The constitution of the Church, its ritual, its discipline, had
undergone no change. In Saxony, and even at Wittemberg,
wherever the new ideas had penetrated, the papal worship
continued with its usual pomp; the priest before the altar,
offering the host to God, appeared to effect an ineffable transubstantiation;
monks and nuns entered the convents and
took their eternal vows; the pastors of the flocks lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
without families; religious brotherhoods met together; pilgrimages
were undertaken; believers hung their votive offerings
on the pillars of the chapels; and all the ceremonies, even
to the most insignificant observances of the sanctuary, were
celebrated as before. There was a new life in the world, but
it had not yet created a new body. The language of the
priest formed the most striking contrast with his actions.
He might be heard thundering from the pulpit against
the mass, as being an idolatrous worship; and then might
be seen coming down to the altar, and scrupulously performing
the pomps of this mystery. In every quarter the new
Gospel sounded in the midst of the ancient rites. The priest
himself did not perceive this strange contradiction; and the
people, who had admiringly listened to the bold language of
the new preachers, devoutly practised the old observances,
as if they were never to lay them aside. Everything remained
the same, at the domestic hearth and in social life,
as in the house of God. There was a new faith in the world,
but not new works. The sun of spring had shone forth, but
winter still seemed to bind all nature; there were no flowers,
no foliage, nothing outwardly that gave token of the change of
season. But these appearances were deceitful; a vigorous
sap was circulating unperceived below the surface, and was
about to change the aspect of the world.</p>

<p>It is perhaps to this prudent progress that the Reformation
is indebted for its triumphs. Every revolution should
be accomplished in the mind before it is carried out externally.
The inconsistency we have noticed did not even
strike Luther at first. It seemed to him quite natural that
the people, who read his works with enthusiasm, should remain
devoutly attached to the abuses which they assailed.
One might almost fancy he had sketched his plan beforehand,
and had resolved to change the mind before changing the
forms. But this would be ascribing to him a wisdom the
honour of which belongs to a higher Intelligence. He carried
out a plan that he had not himself conceived. At a
later period he could recognise and discern these things: but
he did not imagine them, and did not arrange them so. God
led the way: it was Luther's duty to follow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A NEW ERA.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>If Luther had begun by an external reform; if, as soon as
he had spoken, he had attempted to abolish monastic vows,
the mass, confession, and forms of worship, most assuredly
he would have met with a vigorous resistance. Man
requires time to accommodate himself to great revolutions.
But Luther was by no means the violent, imprudent,
daring innovator that some historians have described.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The
people, seeing no change in their customary devotions,
fearlessly abandoned themselves to their new teacher. They
were even surprised at the attacks directed against a man
who still left them their mass, their beads, their confessor;
and attributed them to the low jealousy of obscure rivals, or
to the cruel injustice of powerful adversaries. Yet Luther's
opinions agitated their minds, renewed their hearts, and so
undermined the ancient edifice that it soon fell of itself,
without human agency. Ideas do not act instantaneously;
they make their way in silence, like the waters that, filtering
behind the rocks of the Alps, loosen them from the mountain
on which they rest; suddenly the work done in secret
reveals itself, and a single day is sufficient to lay bare the
agency of many years, perhaps of many centuries.</p>

<p>A new era was beginning for the Reformation. Already
truth was restored in its doctrine; now the doctrine is about
to restore truth in all the forms of the Church and of society.
The agitation is too great for men's minds to remain fixed
and immovable at the point they have attained. Upon those
dogmas, now so mightily shaken, were based customs that
were already tottering to their fall, and which must disappear
with them. There is too much courage and life in the new
generation for it to continue silent before error. Sacraments,
public worship, hierarchy, vows, constitution, domestic and
public life,&mdash;all are about to be modified. The ship, slowly
and laboriously constructed, is about to quit the docks and
to be launched on the open sea. We shall have to follow its
progress through many shoals.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="sidenote">USEFULNESS OF LUTHER'S CAPTIVITY.</div>

<p>The captivity of the Wartburg separates these two periods.
Providence, which was making ready to give so great an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
impulse to the Reformation, had prepared its progress by
leading into profound retirement the instrument destined to
effect it. The work seemed for a time buried with the workman;
but the seed must be laid in the earth, that it may
bring forth fruit; and from this prison, which seemed to be
the reformer's tomb, the Reformation was destined to go
forth to new conquests, and to spread erelong over the whole
world.</p>

<p>Hitherto the Reformation had been centred in the person
of Luther. His appearance before the Diet of Worms was
doubtless the sublimest day of his life. His character appeared
at that time almost spotless; and it is this which has
given rise to the observation, that if God, who concealed the
reformer for ten months within the walls of the Wartburg,
had that instant removed him for ever from the eyes of the
world, his end would have been as an apotheosis. But God
designs no apotheosis for his servant; and Luther was preserved
to the Church, in order to teach, by his very faults,
that the faith of Christians should be based on the Word of
God alone. He was transported suddenly far from the stage
on which the great revolution of the sixteenth century was
taking place; the truth, that for four years he had so powerfully
proclaimed, continued in his absence to act upon Christendom:
and the work, of which he was but the feeble instrument,
henceforward bore the seal not of man, but of God
himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AGITATION IN GERMANY.</div>

<p>Germany was moved at Luther's captivity. The most
contradictory rumours were circulated in the provinces. The
reformer's absence excited men's minds more than his presence
could have done. In one place it was said that friends
from France had placed him in safety on the other bank of
the Rhine;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> in another, that he had fallen by the dagger of
the assassin. Even in the smallest villages inquiries were
made about Luther; travellers were stopped and questioned;
and groups collected in the public places. At times some unknown
orator would recount in a spirit-stirring narrative how
the doctor had been carried off; he described the cruel horsemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
tying their prisoner's hands, spurring their horses, and dragging
him after them on foot, until his strength was exhausted,
stopping their ears to his cries, and forcing the blood from
his limbs.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> "Luther's body," added he, "has been seen
pierced through and through."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> As they heard this, the
listeners uttered cries of sorrow. "Alas!" said they, "we
shall never see or hear that noble-minded man again,
whose voice stirred our very hearts!" Luther's friends
trembled with indignation, and swore to avenge his death.
Women, children, men of peace, and the aged, beheld with
affright the prospect of new struggles. Nothing could equal
the alarm of the partisans of Rome. The priests and monks,
who at first had not been able to conceal their exultation,
thinking themselves secure of victory because one man was
dead, and who had raised their heads with an insulting air of
triumph, would now have fled far from the threatening anger
of the people.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> These men, who, while Luther was free, had
given the reins to their fury, trembled now that he was a
captive.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Aleander, especially, was astounded. "The only
remaining way of saving ourselves," wrote a Roman-catholic
to the Archbishop of Mentz, "is to light torches and hunt
for Luther through the whole world, to restore him to the
nation that is calling for him."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> One might have said that
the pale ghost of the reformer, dragging his chains, was
spreading terror around, and calling for vengeance. "Luther's
death," exclaimed some, "will cause torrents of blood
to be shed."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ENTHUSIASM.</div>

<p>In no place was there such commotion as in Worms itself;
resolute murmurs were heard among both people and princes.
Ulrich Hütten and Hermann Busch filled the country with
their plaintive strains and songs of battle. Charles V. and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the nuncios were publicly accused. The nation took up the
cause of the poor monk, who, by the strength of his faith,
had become their leader.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MELANCTHON AND LUTHER.</div>

<p>At Wittemberg, his colleagues and friends, and especially
Melancthon, were at first sunk in the deepest affliction.
Luther had imparted to this young scholar the treasures of
that holy theology which had from that time wholly occupied
his mind. Luther had given substance and life to that purely
intellectual cultivation which Melancthon had brought to
Wittemberg. The depth of the reformer's teaching had
struck the youthful Hellenist, and the doctor's courage in
maintaining the rights of the everlasting Gospel against all
human authority had filled him with enthusiasm. He had
become a partner in his labours; he had taken up the pen,
and with that purity of style which he derived from the
study of the ancients, he had successively, and with a hand
of power, lowered the authority of the fathers and councils
before the sovereign Word of God.</p>

<p>Melancthon showed the same decision in his learning that
Luther displayed in his actions. Never were there two men
of greater diversity, and at the same time of greater unity.
"Scripture," said Melancthon, "imparts to the soul a holy
and marvellous delight: it is the heavenly ambrosia."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>&mdash;
"The Word of God," exclaimed Luther, "is a sword, a war,
a destruction; it falls upon the children of Ephraim like a
lioness in the forest." Thus, one saw in the Scriptures a
power to console, and the other a violent opposition against
the corruptions of the world. But both esteemed it the
greatest thing on earth; and hence they agreed in perfect
harmony. "Melancthon," said Luther, "is a wonder; all
men confess it now. He is the most formidable enemy of
Satan and the schoolmen, for he knows their foolishness, and
Christ the rock. The little Grecian surpasses me even in
divinity; he will be as serviceable to you as many Luthers."
And he added that he was ready to abandon any opinion of
which Philip did not approve. On his part, too, Melancthon,
filled with admiration at Luther's knowledge of Scripture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
set him far above the fathers of the Church. He would
make excuses for the jests with which Luther was reproached,
and compared him to an earthen vessel that contains
a precious treasure beneath its coarse exterior. "I
should be very unwilling to reprove him inconsiderately for
this matter," said Melancthon.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MELANCTHON'S SORROW.</div>

<p>But now, these two hearts, so closely united, were separated.
These two valiant soldiers can no longer march side
by side to the deliverance of the Church. Luther has disappeared;
perhaps he is lost for ever. The consternation at
Wittemberg was extreme: like that of an army, with gloomy
and dejected looks, before the blood-stained body of their
general who was leading them on to victory.</p>

<p>Suddenly more comforting news arrived. "Our beloved
father lives,"<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> exclaimed Philip in the joy of his soul; "take
courage and be firm." But it was not long before their dejection
returned. Luther was alive, but in prison. The
edict of Worms, with it terrible proscriptions,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> was circulated
by thousands throughout the empire, and even among
the mountains of the Tyrol.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Would not the Reformation
be crushed by the iron hand that was weighing upon it?
Melancthon's gentle spirit was overwhelmed with sorrow.</p>

<p>But the influence of a mightier hand was felt above the
hand of man; God himself deprived the formidable edict of
all its strength. The German princes, who had always
sought to diminish the power of Rome in the empire,
trembled at the alliance between the emperor and the pope,
and feared that it would terminate in the destruction of
their liberty. Accordingly, while Charles in his journey
through the Low Countries greeted with an ironical smile
the burning piles which flatterers and fanatics kindled on
the public places with Luther's works, these very writings
were read in Germany with a continually increasing eagerness,
and numerous pamphlets in favour of the reform were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
daily inflicting some new blow on the papacy. The nuncios
were distracted at seeing this edict, the fruit of so many intrigues,
producing so little effect. "The ink with which
Charles V. signed his arrest," said they bitterly, "is scarcely
dry, and yet the imperial decree is everywhere torn in pieces."
The people were becoming more and more attached to the
admirable man who, heedless of the thunders of Charles and
of the pope, had confessed his faith with the courage of a
martyr. "He offered to retract," said they, "if he were refuted,
and no one dared undertake the task. Does not this
prove the truth of his doctrines?" Thus the first movement
of alarm was succeeded in Wittemberg and the whole empire
by a movement of enthusiasm. Even the Archbishop of
Mentz, witnessing this outburst of popular sympathy, dared
not give the Cordeliers permission to preach against the reformer.
The university, that seemed on the point of being
crushed, raised its head. The new doctrines were too firmly
established for them to be shaken by Luther's absence; and
the halls of the academy could hardly contain the crowd of
hearers.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Luther in the Wartburg&mdash;Object of his Captivity&mdash;Anxiety&mdash;Sickness&mdash;Luther's
Labours&mdash;On Confession&mdash;Reply to Latomus&mdash;His daily
Walks.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">OBJECT OF LUTHER'S CAPTIVITY.</div>

<p>Meantime the Knight George, for by that name Luther was
called in the Wartburg, lived solitary and unknown. "If
you were to see me," wrote he to Melancthon, "you would
take me for a soldier, and even <i>you</i> would hardly recognise
me."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Luther at first indulged in repose, enjoying a leisure
which had not hitherto been allowed him. He wandered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
freely through the fortress, but could not go beyond the walls.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
All his wishes were attended to, and he had never been
better treated.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> A crowd of thoughts filled his soul; but
none had power to trouble him. By turns he looked down
upon the forests that surrounded him, and raised his eyes
towards heaven. "A strange prisoner am I," exclaimed he,
"captive with and against my will!"<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>"Pray for me," wrote he to Spalatin; "your prayers are
the only thing I need. I do not grieve for any thing that
may be said of me in the world. At last I am at rest."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
This letter, as well as many others of the same period,
is dated from the island of Patmos. Luther compared the
Wartburg to that celebrated island to which the wrath of
Domitian in former times had banished the Apostle John.</p>

<p>In the midst of the dark forests of Thuringia the reformer
reposed from the violent struggles that had agitated his
soul. There he studied christian truth, not for the purpose
of contending, but as a means of regeneration and life. The
beginning of the Reformation was of necessity polemical;
new times required new labours. After cutting down the
thorns and the thickets, it was requisite to sow the Word
of God peaceably in the heart. If Luther had been incessantly
called upon to fight fresh battles, he would not have
accomplished a durable work in the Church. Thus by his
captivity he escaped a danger which might possibly have
ruined the Reformation,&mdash;that of always attacking and destroying
without ever defending or building up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PEACE&mdash;ANGUISH.</div>

<p>This humble retreat had a still more precious result.
Uplifted by his countrymen, as on a shield, he was on the
verge of the abyss; the least giddiness might have plunged
him into it headlong. Some of the first promoters of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Reformation both in Germany and Switzerland, ran upon the
shoal of spiritual pride and fanaticism. Luther was a man
very subject to the infirmities of our nature, and he was unable
to escape altogether from these dangers. The hand of
God, however, delivered him for a time, by suddenly removing
him from the sphere of intoxicating ovations, and throwing
him into an unknown retreat. There his soul was wrapt in
pious meditation at God's footstool; it was again tempered in
the waters of adversity; its sufferings and humiliation compelled
him to walk, for a time at least, with the humble; and
the principles of a christian life were thenceforward evolved
in his soul with greater energy and freedom.</p>

<p>Luther's calmness was not of long duration. Seated in
loneliness on the ramparts of the Wartburg, he remained
whole days lost in deep meditation. At one time the Church
appeared before him, displaying all her wretchedness;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> at
another, directing his eyes hopefully towards heaven, he
could exclaim: "Wherefore, O Lord, hast thou made all men
in vain?" (Psalm lxxxix. 48.) And then, giving way to
despair, he cried with dejection: "Alas! there is no one in
this latter day of his anger, to stand like a wall before the
Lord, and save Israel!"</p>

<p>Then recurring to his own destiny, he feared lest he should
be accused of deserting the field of battle;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and this supposition
weighed down his soul. "I would rather," said
he, "be stretched on coals of fire, than lie here half-dead."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Transporting himself in imagination to Worms and Wittemberg,
into the midst of his adversaries, he regretted
having yielded to the advice of his friends, that he had
quitted the world, and that he had not presented his bosom
to the fury of men.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> "Alas!" said he, "there is nothing I
desire more than to appear before my cruelest enemies."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HOPE&mdash;SICKNESS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Gentler thoughts, however, brought a truce to such
anxiety. Everything was not storm and tempest for Luther;
from time to time his agitated mind found tranquillity and
comfort. Next to the certainty of God's help, one thing
consoled him in his sorrows; it was the recollection of
Melancthon. "If I perish," wrote he, "the Gospel will
lose nothing:<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> you will succeed me as Elisha did Elijah,
with a double portion of my spirit." But calling to mind
Philip's timidity, he exclaimed with energy: "Minister of the
Word! keep the walls and towers of Jerusalem, until you
are struck down by the enemy. As yet we stand alone
upon the field of battle; after me, they will aim their blows
at you."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The thought of the final attack Rome was about to make
on the infant Church, renewed his anxieties. The poor
monk, solitary and a prisoner, had many a combat to fight
alone. But a hope of deliverance speedily dawned upon him.
It appeared to him that the assaults of the Papacy would
raise the whole German nation, and that the victorious
soldiers of the Gospel would surround the Wartburg and
restore the prisoner to liberty. "If the pope," said he,
"lays his hand on all those who are on my side, there will
be a disturbance in Germany; the greater his haste to crush
us, the sooner will come the end of the pope and his followers.
And I......I shall be restored to you.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> God is
awakening the hearts of many, and stirring up the nations.
Only let our enemies clasp our affair in their arms and try
to stifle it; it will gather strength under their pressure, and
come forth ten times more formidable."</p>

<div class="sidenote">SICKNESS&mdash;HIS FRIENDS' ANXIETY.</div>

<p>But sickness brought him down from those high places on
which his courage and his faith had placed him. He had
already suffered much at Worms; his disease increased in
solitude.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> He could not endure the food at the Wartburg,
which was less coarse than that of his convent; they were
compelled to give him the meagre diet to which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
been accustomed. He passed whole nights without sleep.
Anxieties of mind were superadded to the pains of the body.
No great work is ever accomplished without suffering and
martyrdom. Luther, alone upon his rock, endured in his
strong frame a passion that the emancipation of the human
race rendered necessary. "Seated by night in my chamber
I uttered groans, like a woman in her travail; torn, wounded,
and bleeding"<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>......then breaking off his complaints, touched
with the thought that his sufferings are a blessing from God,
he exclaimed with love: "Thanks be to Thee, O Christ,
that thou wilt not leave me without the precious marks of
thy cross!"<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> But soon, growing angry with himself, he
cried out: "Madman and hard-hearted that I am! Woe is
me! I pray seldom, I seldom wrestle with the Lord, I
groan not for the Church of God!<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Instead of being fervent
in spirit, my passions take fire; I live in idleness, in sleep,
and indolence!" Then, not knowing to what he should
attribute this state, and accustomed to expect everything
from the affection of his brethren, he exclaimed in the desolation
of his heart: "O my friends! do you then forget to
pray for me, that God is thus far from me?"</p>

<p>Those who were around him, as well as his friends at
Wittemberg and at the elector's court, were uneasy and
alarmed at this state of suffering. They feared lest they
should see the life they had rescued from the flames of the
pope and the sword of Charles V. decline sadly and expire.
Was the Wartburg destined to be Luther's tomb? "I fear,"
said Melancthon, "that the grief he feels for the Church will
cause his death. A fire has been kindled by him in Israel;
if he dies, what hope will remain for us? Would to God,
that at the cost of my own wretched life, I could retain in
the world that soul which is its fairest ornament!<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>&mdash;Oh!
what a man!" exclaimed he, as if already standing on the
side of his grave; "we never appreciated him rightly!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S LABOURS&mdash;CONFESSION.</div>

<p>What Luther denominated the shameful indolence of his
prison was a task that almost exceeded the strength of one
man. "I am here all the day," wrote he on the 14th of
May, "in idleness and pleasures (alluding doubtless to the
better diet that was provided him at first). I am reading
the Bible in Hebrew and Greek; I am going to write a
treatise in German on Auricular Confession; I shall continue
the translation of the Psalms, and compose a volume
of sermons, so soon as I have received what I want from
Wittemberg. I am writing without intermission."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> And
yet this was but a part of his labours.</p>

<p>His enemies thought that, if he were not dead, at least
they should hear no more of him; but their joy was not of
long duration, and there could be no doubt that he was
alive. A multitude of writings, composed in the Wartburg,
succeeded each other rapidly, and the beloved voice of the reformer
was everywhere hailed with enthusiasm. Luther published
simultaneously works calculated to edify the Church,
and polemical tracts which troubled the too eager exultation
of his enemies. For nearly a whole year, he by turns instructed,
exhorted, reproved, and thundered from his mountain-retreat;
and his amazed adversaries asked one another
if there was not something supernatural, some mystery, in
this prodigious activity. "He could never have taken any
rest," says Cochl&oelig;us.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>But there was no other mystery than the imprudence of
the partisans of Rome. They hastened to take advantage
of the edict of Worms, to strike a decisive blow at the Reformation;
and Luther, condemned, under the ban of the
empire, and a prisoner in the Wartburg, undertook to defend
the sound doctrine, as if he were still victorious and at
liberty. It was especially at the tribunal of penance that
the priests endeavoured to rivet the chains of their docile
parishioners; and accordingly the confessional was the object
of Luther's first attack. "They bring forward," said
he, "these words of St. James: <i>Confess your faults to
one another</i>. Singular confessor! his name is <i>One Another</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Whence it would follow that the confessors should also confess
themselves to their penitents; that each Christian should
be, in his turn, pope, bishop, priest; and that the pope himself
should confess to all!"<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">REPLY TO LATOMUS&mdash;LUTHER'S PROMENADES.</div>

<p>Luther had scarcely finished this tract when he began another.
A theologian of Louvain, by name Latomus, already
notorious by his opposition to Reuchlin and Erasmus, had
attacked the reformer's opinions. In twelve days Luther's
refutation was ready, and it is a masterpiece. He clears
himself of the reproach that he was wanting in moderation.
"The moderation of the day," said he, "is to bend the knee
before sacrilegious pontiffs, impious sophists, and to say to
them: Gracious lord! Excellent master! Then, when you
have so done, you may put any one you please to death;
you may even convulse the world, and you will be none
the less a man of moderation......Away with such moderation!
I would rather be frank and deceive no one. The shell
may be hard, but the kernel is soft and tender."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>As Luther's health continued feeble, he thought of leaving
the place of his confinement. But how could he manage it?
To appear in public would be exposing his life. The back
of the mountain on which the fortress stood was crossed
by numerous footways, bordered by tufts of strawberries.
The heavy gate of the castle opened, and the prisoner ventured,
not without fear, to gather some of the fruit.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> By
degrees he grew bolder, and in his knight's garb began to
wander through the surrounding country, attended by one
of the guards of the castle, a worthy but somewhat churlish
man. One day, having entered an inn, Luther threw aside
his sword, which encumbered him, and hastily took up some
books that lay there. His nature got the better of his
prudence. His guardian trembled for fear this movement, so
extraordinary in a soldier, should excite suspicions that the
doctor was not really a knight. At another time the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
comrades alighted at the convent of Reinhardsbrunn, where
Luther had slept a few months before on his road to Worms.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Suddenly one of the lay-brothers uttered a cry of surprise.
Luther was recognised. His attendant perceived it, and
dragged him hastily away; and already they were galloping
far from the cloister before the astonished brother had
recovered from his amazement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A HUNTING-PARTY.</div>

<p>The military life of the doctor had at intervals something
about it truly theological. One day the nets were made ready&mdash;the
gates of the fortress opened&mdash;the long-eared dogs rushed
forth. Luther desired to taste the pleasures of the chase.
The huntsmen soon grew animated; the dogs sprang forward,
driving the game from the covers. In the midst of all
this uproar, the Knight George stands motionless: his mind
is occupied with serious thoughts; the objects around him
fill his heart with sorrow.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> "Is not this," says he, "the
image of the devil setting on his dogs&mdash;that is, the bishops,
those representatives of Antichrist, and urging them in pursuit
of poor souls?"<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> A young hare was taken: delighted
at the prospect of liberating it, he wrapped it carefully in his
cloak, and set it down in the midst of a thicket; but hardly
had he taken a few steps before the dogs scented the animal
and killed it. Luther, attracted by the noise, uttered a groan
of sorrow, and exclaimed: "O pope! and thou, too, Satan!
it is thus ye endeavour to destroy even those souls that have
been saved from death!"<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Commencement of the Reform&mdash;Marriage of Feldkirchen&mdash;The Marriage
of Monks&mdash;Theses&mdash;Tract against Monachism&mdash;Luther no longer a
Monk.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">COMMENCEMENT OF THE REFORM.</div>
<p>While the doctor of Wittemberg, thus dead to the world,
was seeking relaxation in these sports in the neighbourhood
of the Wartburg, the work was going on as if of itself: the
Reform was beginning; it was no longer restricted to
doctrine, it entered deeply into men's actions. Bernard
Feldkirchen, pastor of Kemberg, the first under Luther's
directions to attack the errors of Rome,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> was also the first
to throw off the yoke of its institutions. He married.</p>

<p>The Germans are fond of social life and domestic joys;
and hence, of all the papal ordinances, compulsory celibacy
was that which produced the saddest consequences. This
law, which had been first imposed on the heads of the
clergy, had prevented the ecclesiastical fiefs from becoming
hereditary. But when extended by Gregory VII. to the
inferior clergy, it was attended with the most deplorable
results. Many priests had evaded the obligations imposed
upon them by the most scandalous disorders, and had drawn
contempt and hatred on the whole body; while those who
had submitted to Hildebrand's law were inwardly exasperated
against the Church, because, while conferring on its superior
dignitaries so much power, wealth, and earthly enjoyment,
it bound its humbler ministers, who were its most useful
supporters, to a self-denial so contrary to the Gospel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MARRIAGE OF MONKS.</div>

<p>"Neither popes nor councils," said Feldkirchen and another
pastor named Seidler, who had followed his example, "can
impose any commandment on the Church that endangers
body and soul. The obligation of keeping God's law compels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
me to violate the traditions of men."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The re-establishment
of marriage in the sixteenth century was a homage paid to
the moral law. The ecclesiastical authority became alarmed,
and immediately fulminated its decrees against these two
priests. Seidler, who was in the territories of Duke George,
was given up to his superiors, and died in prison. But the
Elector Frederick refused to surrender Feldkirchen to the
Archbishop of Magdeburg. "His highness," said Spalatin,
"declines to act the part of a constable." Feldkirchen
therefore continued pastor of his flock, although a husband
and a father.</p>

<p>The first emotion of the reformer when he heard of this was
to give way to exultation: "I admire this new bridegroom
of Kemberg," said he, "who fears nothing, and hastens
forward in the midst of the uproar." Luther was of opinion
that priests ought to marry. But this question led to
another,&mdash;the marriage of monks; and here Luther had to
support one of those internal struggles of which his whole
life was composed; for every reform must first be won by
a spiritual struggle. Melancthon and Carlstadt, the one a
layman, the other a priest, thought that the liberty of contracting
the bonds of wedlock should be as free for the monks
as for the priests. The monk Luther did not think so at
first. One day the governor of the Wartburg having brought
him Carlstadt's theses on celibacy: "Gracious God!" exclaimed
he, "our Wittembergers then will give wives even
to the monks!"......This thought surprised and confounded
him; his heart was troubled. He rejected for himself the
liberty that he claimed for others. "Ah!" said he indignantly,
"they will not force <i>me</i> at least to take a wife."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
This expression is doubtless unknown to those who assert
that Luther preached the Reformation that he might marry.
Inquiring for truth, not with passion, but with uprightness
of purpose, he maintained what seemed to him true,
although contrary to the whole of his system. He walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
in a mixture of error and truth, until error had fallen and
truth remained alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STRUGGLE WITH MONACHISM.</div>

<p>There was, indeed, a great difference between the two
questions. The marriage of priests was not the destruction
of the priesthood; on the contrary, this of itself might restore
to the secular clergy the respect of the people; but the
marriage of monks was the downfall of monachism. It
became a question, therefore, whether it was desirable to
disband and break up that powerful army which the popes
had under their orders. "Priests," wrote Luther to Melancthon,
"are of divine appointment, and consequently are
free as regards human commandments. But of their own
free will the monks adopted celibacy; they are not therefore
at liberty to withdraw from the yoke they voluntarily imposed
on themselves."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The reformer was destined to advance, and carry by a
fresh struggle this new position of the enemy. Already had
he trodden under foot a host of Roman abuses, and even
Rome herself; but monachism still remained standing.
Monachism, that had once carried life into so many deserts,
and which, passing through so many centuries, was now filling
the cloisters with sloth and often with licentiousness,
seemed to have embodied itself and gone to defend its rights
in that castle of Thuringia, where the question of its life and
death was discussed in the conscience of one man. Luther
struggled with it: at one moment he was on the point of
gaining the victory, at another he was nearly overcome. At
length, unable longer to maintain the contest, he flung himself
in prayer at the feet of Jesus Christ, exclaiming: "Teach
us, deliver us, establish us, by Thy mercy, in the liberty that
belongs to us; for of a surety we are thy people!"<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">VICTORY&mdash;THESES.</div>

<p>He had not long to wait for deliverance; an important
revolution was effected in the reformer's mind; and again it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was the doctrine of justification by faith that gave him
victory. That arm which had overthrown the indulgences,
the practices of Rome, and the pope himself, also wrought
the downfall of the monks in Luther's mind and throughout
Christendom. Luther saw that monachism was in violent
opposition to the doctrine of salvation by grace, and that a
monastic life was founded entirely on the pretended merits
of man. Feeling convinced, from that hour, that Christ's
glory was interested in this question, he heard a voice incessantly
repeating in his conscience: "Monachism must
fall!"&mdash;"So long as the doctrine of justification by faith
remains pure and undefiled in the Church, no one can become
a monk," said he.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> This conviction daily grew
stronger in his heart, and about the beginning of September
he sent "to the bishops and deacons of the Church of
Wittemberg," the following theses, which were his declaration
of war against a monastic life:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whatsoever is not of faith is sin (Rom. xiv. 23).</p>

<p>"Whosoever maketh a vow of virginity, chastity, of service
to God without faith, maketh an impious and idolatrous vow,&mdash;a
vow to the devil himself.</p>

<p>"To make such vows is worse than the priests of Cybele
or the vestals of the pagans; for the monks make their
vows in the thought of being justified and saved by these
vows; and what ought to be ascribed solely to the mercy of
God, is thus attributed to meritorious works.</p>

<p>"We must utterly overthrow such convents, as being the
abodes of the devil.</p>

<p>"There is but one order that is holy and makes man holy,
and that is Christianity or faith.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>"For convents to be useful they should be converted into
schools, where children should be brought up to man's estate;
instead of which they are houses where adult men become
children, and remain so for ever."</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER REJECTS MONACHISM.</div>

<p>We see that Luther would still have tolerated convents
as places of education; but erelong his attacks against these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
establishments became more violent. The immorality and
shameful practices that prevailed in the cloisters recurred
forcibly to his thoughts. "I am resolved," wrote he to
Spalatin on the 11th of November, "to deliver the young
from the hellish fires of celibacy."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> He now wrote a book
against monastic vows, which he dedicated to his father:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you desire," said he in his dedication to the old
man at Mansfeldt, "do you still desire to rescue me from a
monastic life? You have the right, for you are still my
father, and I am still your son. But that is no longer necessary:
God has been beforehand with you, and has Himself
delivered me by his power. What matters it whether I
wear or lay aside the tonsure and the cowl? Is it the cowl&mdash;is
it the tonsure&mdash;that makes the monk? <i>All things are
yours</i>, says St. Paul, <i>and you are Christ's</i>. I do not belong
to the cowl, but the cowl to me. I am a monk, and yet not
a monk; I am a new creature, not of the pope, but of Jesus
Christ. Christ, alone and without any go-between, is my
bishop, my abbot, my prior, my lord, my father, and my
master; and I know no other. What matters it to me if
the pope should condemn me and put me to death? He
cannot call me from the grave and kill me a second time......The
great day is drawing near in which the kingdom of
abominations shall be overthrown. Would to God that it
were worth while for the pope to put us all to death! Our
blood would cry out to heaven against him, and thus his
condemnation would be hastened, and his end be near."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The transformation had already been effected in Luther
himself; he was no longer a monk. It was not outward
circumstances, or earthly passions, or carnal precipitation
that had wrought this change. There had been a struggle:
at first Luther had taken the side of monachism; but truth
also had gone down into the lists, and monachism had fallen
before it. The victories that passion gains are ephemeral;
those of truth are lasting and decisive.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Archbishop Albert&mdash;The Idol of Halle&mdash;Luther's Indignation&mdash;Alarm of
the Court&mdash;Luther's Letter to the Archbishop&mdash;Albert's Reply&mdash;Joachim
of Brandenburg.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">ARCHBISHOP ALBERT.</div>

<p>While Luther was thus preparing the way for one of the
greatest revolutions that were destined to be effected in the
Church, and the Reformation was beginning to enter powerfully
into the lives of Christians, the Romish partisans, blind
as those generally are who have long been in possession of
power, imagined that, because Luther was in the Wartburg,
the Reform was dead and for ever extinct; and fancied they
should be able quietly to resume their ancient practices, that
had been for a moment disturbed by the monk of Wittemberg.
Albert, elector-archbishop of Mentz, was one of those
weak men who, all things being equal, decide for the truth;
but who, as soon as their interest is put in the balance, are
ready to take part with error. His most important aim was
to have a court as brilliant as that of any prince in Germany,
his equipages as rich, and his table as well furnished: the
traffic in indulgences served admirably to obtain this result.
Accordingly, the decree against Luther had scarcely issued
from the imperial chancery, before Albert, who was then residing
with his court at Halle, summoned the vendors of
indulgences, who were still alarmed at the words of the reformer,
and endeavoured to encourage them by such language
as this: "Fear nothing, we have silenced him; let us begin
to shear the flock in peace; the monk is a prisoner; he is
confined by bolts and bars; this time he will be very clever
if he comes again to disturb us in our affairs." The market
was reopened, the merchandise was displayed for sale, and
again the churches of Halle re-echoed with the speeches of
the mountebanks.</p>

<p>But Luther was still alive, and his voice was powerful
enough to pass beyond the walls and gratings behind which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
he had been hidden. Nothing could have roused his indignation
to a higher pitch. What! the most violent battles
have been fought; he has confronted every danger; the
truth remained victorious, and yet they dare trample it
under foot, as if it had been vanquished!......That voice
shall again be heard, which has once already put an end to
this criminal traffic. "I shall enjoy no rest," wrote he to
Spalatin, "until I have attacked the idol of Mentz with its
brothel at Halle."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE IDOL OF HALLE.</div>

<p>Luther set to work immediately; he cared little about the
mystery with which some sought to envelop his residence in
the Wartburg. He was like Elijah in the desert forging
fresh thunderbolts against the impious Ahab. On the first
of November he finished his treatise <i>Against the New Idol of
Halle</i>.</p>

<p>Intelligence of Luther's plans reached the archbishop.
Alarmed and in emotion at the very idea, he sent about the
middle of October two of his attendants (Capito and Auerbach)
to Wittemberg to avert the storm. "Luther must
moderate his impetuosity," said they to Melancthon, who received
them cordially. But Melancthon, although mild himself,
was not one of those who imagine that wisdom consists
in perpetual concession, tergiversation, and silence.
"It is God who moves him," replied he, "and our age needs
a bitter and pungent salt."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Upon this Capito turned to
Jonas, and endeavoured through him to act upon the court.
The news of Luther's intention was already known there,
and produced great amazement. "What!" said the courtiers:
"rekindle the fire that we have had so much trouble
to extinguish! Luther can only be saved by being forgotten,
and yet he is rising up against the first prince in the
empire!"&mdash;"I will not suffer Luther to write against the
Archbishop of Mentz, and thus disturb the public tranquillity,"
said the elector.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S INDIGNATION.</div>

<p>Luther was annoyed when these words were repeated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
him. Is it not enough to imprison his body, but they will also
enchain his mind, and the truth with it?......Do they fancy
that he hides himself through fear, and that his retirement is
an avowal of defeat? He maintains that it is a victory. Who
dared stand up against him at Worms and oppose the truth?
Accordingly when the captive in the Wartburg had read the
chaplain's letter, informing him of the prince's sentiments, he
flung it aside, determined to make no reply. But he could not
long contain himself; he took up the epistle and wrote to
Spalatin: "The elector will not suffer!......and I too will not
suffer the elector <i>not</i> to permit me to write......Rather would
I destroy yourself, the elector, nay, the whole world for ever!<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
If I have resisted the pope, who is the creator of your cardinal,
why should I give way before his creature? It is very
fine, forsooth, to hear you say that we must not disturb the
public tranquillity, while you allow the everlasting peace
of God to be disturbed!......Spalatin, it shall not be so!
Prince, it shall not be so!<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> I send you a book I had already
prepared against the cardinal when I received your letter.
Forward it to Melancthon."</p>

<p>Spalatin trembled as he read this manuscript; again he
represented to the reformer how imprudent it would be to
publish a work that would force the imperial government to
lay aside its apparent ignorance of Luther's fate, and punish
a prisoner who dared attack the greatest prince in the empire
and the Church. If Luther persevered in his designs, the
tranquillity would again be disturbed, and the Reformation
perhaps be lost. Luther consented to delay the publication
of his treatise; he even permitted Melancthon to erase the
most violent passages.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> But, irritated at his friend's timidity,
he wrote to the chaplain: "The Lord lives and reigns,
that Lord in whom you court-folks do not believe, unless he
so accommodate His works to your reason, that there is no
longer any necessity to believe." He then resolved to write
direct to the cardinal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">LETTER TO THE ARCHBISHOP.</div>

<p>It is the whole body of Romish bishops that Luther thus
brings to the bar in the person of the German primate. His
words are those of a bold man, ardent in zeal for the truth,
and who feels that he is speaking in the name of God himself.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"Your electoral highness," wrote he from the depth of
the retreat in which he was hidden, "has set up again in
Halle the idol that swallows the money and the souls of poor
Christians. You think, perhaps, that I am disabled, and
that the emperor will easily stifle the cries of the poor
monk......But know that I shall discharge the duties that
christian charity has imposed upon me, without fearing the
gates of hell, and much less the pope, his bishops, and cardinals.</p>

<p>"For this reason my humble prayer is, that your electoral
highness would remember the beginning of this affair&mdash;how
a tiny spark kindled a terrible conflagration. All the world
was at that time in a state of security. This poor begging
friar (thought they), who unaided would attack the pope, is
too weak for such an undertaking. But God interposed;
and he caused the pope more labour and anxiety than he had
ever felt since he had taken his place in the temple of God
to tyrannize over the Church. This same God still lives:
let none doubt it.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> He will know how to withstand a cardinal
of Mentz, even were he supported by four emperors;
for He is pleased above all things to hew down the lofty cedars
and to abase the haughty Pharaohs.</p>

<p>"For this reason I inform your highness by letter, that if
the idol is not thrown down, I must, in obedience to God's
teaching, publicly attack your highness, as I have attacked
the pope himself. Let your highness conduct yourself in
accordance with this advice; I shall wait a fortnight for an
early and favourable reply. Given in my wilderness, the
Sunday after St Catherine's day, (15th November) 1521.</p>

<p>"From your electoral highness's devoted and obedient
servant,</p>
<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">Martin Luther</span>."</p>


<div class="sidenote">ALBERT'S REPLY.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>This letter was sent to Wittemberg, and from Wittemberg
to Halle, where the cardinal-elector was then residing; for
no one dared intercept it, foreseeing the storm that would be
aroused by so daring an act. But Melancthon accompanied
it by a letter addressed to the prudent Capito, in which he
endeavoured to prepare the way for a favourable termination
of this difficult business.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the feelings of the youthful and
weak archbishop on receiving the reformer's letter. The
work announced <i>against the idol of Halle</i> was like a sword
suspended over his head. And, at the same time, what
anger must have been kindled in his heart by the insolence
of this peasant's son,&mdash;this excommunicated monk, who dared
make use of such language to a prince of the house of Brandenburg,&mdash;the
primate of the German Church? Capito
besought the archbishop to satisfy the monk. Alarm, pride,
and the voice of conscience which he could not stifle, struggled
fearfully in Albert's bosom. At last dread of the book,
and perhaps remorse also, prevailed; he humbled himself:
he put together all he thought calculated to appease
the man of the Wartburg, and a fortnight had barely elapsed
when Luther received the following letter, still more astonishing
than his own terrible epistle:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"My dear Doctor,&mdash;I have received and read your letter,
and have taken it in good part. But I think the motive that
has led you to write me such an epistle has long ceased to
exist. I desire, with God's help, to conduct myself as a pious
bishop and a christian prince, and I confess my need of the
grace of God. I do not deny that I am a sinner, liable to
sin and error, sinning and erring daily. I am well assured
that without God's grace I am worthless and offensive mire,
even as other men, if not more so. In replying to your
letter, I would not conceal this gracious disposition; for I
am more than desirous of showing you all kindness and
favour, for love of Christ. I know how to receive a christian
and fraternal rebuke.</p>

<p class="signature">
"With my own hand.      <span class="smcap">Albert.</span>"</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">WEAKNESS AND STRENGTH.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>Such was the language addressed to the excommunicated
monk of the Wartburg by the Elector-archbishop of Mentz
and Magdeburg, commissioned to represent and maintain in
Germany the constitution of the Church. Did Albert, in
writing it, obey the generous impulses of his conscience, or
his slavish fears? In the first case, it is a noble letter; in
the second, it merits our contempt. We would rather suppose
it originated in the better feelings of his heart. However
that may be, it shows the immeasurable superiority of
God's servants over all the great ones of the earth. While
Luther alone, a prisoner and condemned, derived invincible
courage from his faith, the archbishop, elector and
cardinal, environed with all the power and favours of the
world, trembled on his throne. This contrast appears continually,
and is the key to the strange enigma offered by the
history of the Reformation. The Christian is not called
upon to count his forces, and to number his means of victory.
The only thing he should be anxious about is to
know whether the cause he upholds is really that of God, and
whether he looks only to his Master's glory. Unquestionably
he has an inquiry to make; but this is wholly spiritual,&mdash;the
Christian looks at the heart, and not the arm; he weighs
the justice of his cause, and not its outward strength. And
when this question is once settled, his path is clear. He
must move forward boldly, were it even against the world
and all its armed hosts, in the unshaken conviction that God
himself will fight for him.</p>

<p>The enemies of the Reformation thus passed from extreme
severity to extreme weakness; they had already done the
same at Worms; and these sudden transitions are of continual
occurrence in the battle that error wages against truth.
Every cause destined to fall is attacked with an internal uneasiness
which makes it tottering and uncertain, and drives
it by turns from one pole to the other. Steadiness of purpose
and energy are far better; they would thus perhaps
precipitate its fall, but at least if it did fall it would fall with
glory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOACHIM OF BRANDENBURG.</div>

<p>One of Albert's brothers, Joachim I., elector of Brandenburg,
gave an example of that strength of character which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
is so rare, particularly in our own times. Immovable in
his principles, firm in action, knowing how to resist when
necessary the encroachments of the pope, he opposed an iron
hand to the progress of the Reformation. At Worms he
had insisted that Luther should not be heard, and that he
ought to be punished as a heretic, in despite of his safe-conduct.
Scarcely had the edict of Worms been issued, when
he ordered that it should be strictly enforced throughout his
states. Luther could appreciate so energetic a character,
and making a distinction between Joachim and his other
adversaries, he said: "We may still pray for the Elector of
Brandenburg."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The disposition of this prince seemed to
have been communicated to his people. Berlin and Brandenburg
long remained closed against the Reformation. But
what is received slowly is held faithfully.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> While other
countries, which then hailed the Gospel with joy,&mdash;Belgium
for instance, and Westphalia,&mdash;were soon to abandon it,
Brandenburg, the last of the German states to enter on the
narrow way of faith, was destined in after-years to stand in
the foremost ranks of the Reformation.</p>

<p>Luther did not read Cardinal Albert's letter without a
suspicion that it was dictated by hypocrisy, and in accordance
with the advice of Capito. He kept silence, however,
being content with declaring to the latter, that so long as the
archbishop, who was hardly capable of managing a small
parish, did not lay aside his cardinal's mask and episcopal
pomp, and become a simple minister of the Word, it was
impossible that he could be in the way of salvation.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Translation of the Bible&mdash;Wants of the Church&mdash;Principles of the Reformation&mdash;Temptations
of the Devil&mdash;Luther's Works condemned by
the Sorbonne&mdash;Melancthon's Reply&mdash;Luther Visits Wittemberg.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE.</div>

<p>While Luther was thus struggling against error, as if he
were still in the midst of the battle, he was also labouring
in his retirement of the Wartburg, as if he had no concern
in what was going on in the world. The hour had come in
which the Reformation, from being a mere theological question,
was to become the life of the people; and yet the great
engine by which this progress was to be effected was not yet
in being. This powerful and mighty instrument, destined to
hurl its thunderbolts from every side against the proud edifice
of Rome, throw down its walls, cast off the enormous
weight of the Papacy under which the Church lay stifled,
and communicate an impulse to the whole human race which
would not be lost until the end of time,&mdash;this instrument
was to go forth from the old castle of the Wartburg, and
enter the world on the same day that terminated the reformer's
captivity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WANTS OF THE CHURCH.</div>

<p>The farther the Church was removed from the time when
Jesus, the true Light of the world, was on the earth, the
greater was her need of the torch of God's Word, ordained
to transmit the brightness of Jesus Christ to the men of the
latter days. But this Divine Word was at that time hidden
from the people. Several unsuccessful attempts at translation
from the Vulgate had been made in 1477, 1490, and in
1518; they were almost unintelligible, and from their high
price beyond the reach of the people. It had even been prohibited
to give the German Church the Bible in the vulgar
tongue.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Besides which, the number of those who were
able to read did not become considerable until there existed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
in the German language a book of lively and universal
interest.</p>

<p>Luther was called to present his nation with the Scriptures
of God. That same God who had conducted St. John
to Patmos, <i>there</i> to write his revelation, had confined Luther
in the Wartburg, <i>there</i> to translate His Word. This great
task, which it would have been difficult for him to have
undertaken in the midst of the cares and occupations of
Wittemberg, was to establish the new building on the primitive
rock, and, after the lapse of so many ages, lead Christians
back from the subtleties of the schoolmen to the pure fountain-head
of redemption and salvation.</p>

<p>The wants of the Church spoke loudly; they called for
this great work; and Luther, by his own inward experience,
was to be led to perform it. In truth, he discovered in faith
that repose of the soul which his agitated conscience and his
monastic ideas had long induced him to seek in his own
merits and holiness. The doctrine of the Church, the scholastic
theology, knew nothing of the consolations that proceed
from faith; but the Scriptures proclaim them with great
force, and there it was that he had found them. Faith in
the Word of God had made him free. By it he felt emancipated
from the dogmatical authority of the Church, from
its hierarchy and traditions, from the opinions of the schoolmen,
the power of prejudice, and from every human ordinance.
Those strong and numerous bonds which for centuries
had enchained and stifled Christendom, were snapped asunder,
broken in pieces, and scattered round him; and he nobly
raised his head freed from all authority except that of the
Word. This independence of man, this submission to God,
which he had learned in the Holy Scriptures, he desired to
impart to the Church. But before he could communicate
them, it was necessary to set before it the revelations of
God. A powerful hand was wanted to unlock the massive
gates of that arsenal of God's Word from which Luther had
taken his arms, and to open to the people against the day
of battle those vaults and antique halls which for many ages
no foot had ever trod.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S DESIRE&mdash;PRINCIPLES OF THE REFORM.</div>

<p>Luther had already translated several fragments of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Holy Scripture; the seven penitential Psalms had been his
first task.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> John the Baptist, Christ himself, and the Reformation
had begun alike by calling men to repentance.
It is the principle of every regeneration in the individual
man, and in the whole human race. These essays had
been eagerly received; men longed to have more; and this
voice of the people was considered by Luther as the voice of
God himself. He resolved to reply to the call. He was a
prisoner within those lofty walls; what of that! he will
devote his leisure to translating the Word of God into the
language of his countrymen. Erelong this Word will be
seen descending from the Wartburg with him; circulating
among the people of Germany, and putting them in possession
of those spiritual treasures hitherto shut up within the
hearts of a few pious men. "Would that this one book,"
exclaimed Luther, "were in every language, in every hand,
before the eyes, and in the ears and hearts of all men!"<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
Admirable words, which, after a lapse of three centuries, an
illustrious body,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> translating the Bible into the mother-tongue
of every nation upon earth, has undertaken to realize.
"Scripture without any comment," said he again, "is the
sun whence all teachers receive their light."</p>

<p>Such are the principles of Christianity and of the Reformation.
According to these venerable words, we should not
consult the Fathers to throw light upon Scripture, but
Scripture to explain the Fathers. The reformers and the
apostles set up the Word of God as the only light, as they
exalt the sacrifice of Christ as the only righteousness. By
mingling any authority of man with this absolute authority
of God, or any human righteousness with this perfect
righteousness of Christ, we vitiate both the foundations of
Christianity. These are the two fundamental heresies of
Rome, and which, although doubtless in a smaller degree,
some teachers were desirous of introducing into the bosom
of the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BIBLE IN THE STEAD OF MAN.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>Luther opened the Greek originals of the evangelists and
apostles, and undertook the difficult task of making these
divine teachers speak his mother tongue. Important crisis
in the history of the Reformation! from that time the Reformation
was no longer in the hands of the reformer. The
Bible came forward; Luther withdrew. God appeared, and
man disappeared. The reformer placed <small>THE BOOK</small> in the
hands of his contemporaries. Each one may now hear the
voice of God for himself; as for Luther, henceforth he
mingles with the crowd, and takes his station in the ranks
of those who come to draw from the common fountain of light
and life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TEMPTATIONS OF THE DEVIL.</div>

<p>In translating the Holy Scriptures, Luther found that
consolation and strength, of which he stood so much in need.
Solitary, in ill health, and saddened by the exertions of his
enemies and the extravagances of some of his followers,&mdash;seeing
his life wearing away in the gloom of that old castle,
he had occasionally to endure terrible struggles. In those
times, men were inclined to carry into the visible world the
conflicts that the soul sustains with its spiritual enemies;
Luther's lively imagination easily embodied the emotions of
his heart, and the superstitions of the Middle Ages had still
some hold upon his mind, so that we might say of him,
as it has been said of Calvin with regard to the punishment
inflicted on heretics: there was yet a remnant of popery in
him.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Satan was not in Luther's view simply an invisible
though real being; he thought that this adversary of God
appeared to men as he had appeared to Jesus Christ. Although
the authenticity of many of the stories on this subject
contained in the Table-talk and elsewhere is more than doubtful,
history must still record this failing in the reformer.
Never was he more assailed by these gloomy ideas than in
the solitude of the Wartburg. In the days of his strength
he had braved the devil in Worms; but now all the reformer's
powers seemed broken and his glory tarnished. He
was thrown aside; Satan was victorious in his turn, and in
the anguish of his soul Luther imagined he saw his giant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
form standing before him, lifting his finger in threatening
attitude, exulting with a bitter and hellish sneer, and gnashing
his teeth in fearful rage. One day especially, it is said,
as Luther was engaged on his translation of the New Testament,
he fancied he beheld Satan, filled with horror at his
work, tormenting him, and prowling round him like a lion
about to spring upon his prey. Luther, alarmed and incensed,
snatched up his inkstand and flung it at the head of
his enemy. The figure disappeared, and the missile was
dashed in pieces against the wall.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Luther's sojourn in the Wartburg began to be insupportable
to him. He felt indignant at the timidity of his protectors.
Sometimes he would remain a whole day plunged
in deep and silent meditation, and awakened from it only to
exclaim, "Oh, that I were at Wittemberg!" At length he
could hold out no longer; there has been caution enough;
he must see his friends again, hear them, and converse with
them. True, he runs the risk of falling into the hands of
his enemies, but nothing can stop him. About the end of
November, he secretly quitted the Wartburg, and set out for
Wittemberg.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>A fresh storm had just burst upon him. At last the
Sorbonne had spoken out. That celebrated school of Paris,
the first authority in the Church after the pope, the ancient
and venerable source whence theological teaching had proceeded,
had given its verdict against the Reformation.</p>

<p>The following are some of the propositions condemned by
this learned body. Luther had said, "God ever pardons
and remits sins gratuitously, and requires nothing of us in
return, except that in future we should live according to
righteousness." And he had added, "Of all deadly sins,
this is the most deadly, namely, that any one should think
he is not guilty of a damnable and deadly sin before God."
He had said in another place, "Burning heretics is contrary
to the will of the Holy Ghost."</p>

<div class="sidenote">MELANCTHON'S REPLY TO THE SORBONNE.</div>

<p>To these three propositions, and to many others besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
which they quoted, the theological faculty of Paris replied,
"Heresy!&mdash;let him be accursed!"<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>But a young man, twenty-four years of age, of short stature,
diffident, and plain in appearance, dared take up the
gauntlet which the first college in the world had thrown
down. They knew pretty well at Wittemberg what should
be thought of these pompous censures; they knew that Rome
had yielded to the suggestions of the Dominicans, and that
the Sorbonne was led away by two or three fanatical doctors
who were designated at Paris by satirical nicknames.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Accordingly,
in his Apology, Melancthon did not confine himself
to defending Luther; but, with that boldness which
characterizes his writings, he carried the war into the enemy's
camp. "You say he is a Manichean!&mdash;he is a Montanist!&mdash;let
fire and faggot repress his foolishness! And who is
Montanist? Luther, who would have us believe in Holy
Scripture alone, or you, who would have men believe in the
opinions of their fellow-creatures rather than in the Word
of God?"<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">VISIT TO WITTEMBERG.</div>

<p>To ascribe more importance to the word of a man than to
the Word of God was in very truth the heresy of Montanus,
as it still is that of the pope and of all those who set the hierarchical
authority of the Church or the interior inspirations of
mysticism far above the positive declarations of the Sacred
Writings. Accordingly the youthful master of arts, who
had said, "I would rather lay down my life than my faith,"<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
did not stop there. He accused the Sorbonne of having obscured
the Gospel, extinguished faith, and substituted an
empty philosophy in the place of Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> After this
work of Melancthon's, the position of the dispute was changed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
he proved unanswerably that the heresy was at Paris and
Rome, and the catholic truth at Wittemberg.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Luther, caring little for the condemnations of
the Sorbonne, was proceeding in his military equipment
to the university. He was greatly distressed by various reports
which reached him on the road of a spirit of impatience
and independence that was showing itself among some of his
adherents.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> At length he arrived at Wittemberg without being
recognised, and stopped at Amsdorff's house. Immediately
all his friends were secretly called together;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and Melancthon
among the first, who had so often said, "I would rather die
than lose him."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> They came!&mdash;What a meeting!&mdash;what
joy!&mdash;The captive of the Wartburg tasted in their society
all the sweetness of christian friendship. He learnt the
spread of the Reformation, the hopes of his brethren; and,
delighted at what he saw and heard,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> offered up a prayer,&mdash;returned
thanks to God,&mdash;and then with brief delay returned
to the Wartburg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRESH REFORMS&mdash;GABRIEL ZWILLING.</div>

<p>Luther's joy was well founded. The work of the Reformation
then made a great stride. Feldkirchen, always in the
van, had led the assault; now the main body was in motion,
and that power which carried the Reformation from the
doctrine it had purified into the worship, life, and constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of the Church, now manifested itself by a new explosion,
more formidable to the papacy than even the first had been.</p>

<p>Rome, having got rid of the reformer, thought the heresy
was at an end. But in a short time everything was changed.
Death removed from the pontifical throne the man who had
put Luther under the ban of the Church. Disturbances
occurred in Spain, and compelled Charles to visit his kingdom
beyond the Pyrenees. War broke out between this
prince and Francis I., and as if that were not enough to
occupy the emperor, Soliman made an incursion into Hungary.
Charles, thus attacked on all sides, was forced to
forget the monk of Worms and his religious innovations.</p>

<p>About the same time, the vessel of the Reformation,
which, driven in every direction by contrary winds, was on
the verge of foundering, righted itself, and floated proudly
above the waters.</p>

<p>It was in the convent of the Augustines at Wittemberg
that the Reformation broke out. We ought not to feel surprise
at this: it is true the reformer was there no longer;
but no human power could drive out the spirit that had
animated him.</p>

<p>For some time the Church in which Luther had so often
preached re-echoed with strange doctrines. Gabriel Zwilling,
a zealous monk and chaplain to the convent, was there
energetically proclaiming the Reformation. As if Luther,
whose name was at that time everywhere celebrated, had
become too strong and too illustrious, God selected feeble and
obscure men to begin the Reformation which that renowned
doctor had prepared. "Jesus Christ," said the preacher,
"instituted the sacrament of the altar in remembrance of his
death, and not to make it an object of adoration. To worship
it is a real idolatry. The priest who communicates
alone commits a sin. No prior has the right to compel a
monk to say mass alone. Let one, two, or three officiate,
and let the others receive the Lord's sacrament under both
kinds."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PRIOR&mdash;THE UNIVERSITY.</div>

<p>This is what Friar Gabriel required, and this daring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
language was listened to approvingly by the other brethren,
and particularly by those who came from the Low Countries.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
They were disciples of the Gospel, and why should
they not conform in everything to its commands? Had not
Luther himself written to Melancthon in the month of
August: "Henceforth and for ever I will say no more
private masses?"<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Thus the monks, the soldiers of the
hierarchy, emancipated by the Word, boldly took part
against Rome.</p>

<p>At Wittemberg they met with a violent resistance from
the prior. Calling to mind that all things should be done
with order, they gave way, but with a declaration that to
uphold the mass was to oppose the Gospel of God.</p>

<p>The prior had gained the day: one man had been stronger
than them all. It might seem, therefore, that this movement
of the Augustines was one of those caprices of insubordination
so frequently occurring in monasteries. But it
was in reality the Spirit of God itself which was then
agitating all Christendom. A solitary cry, uttered in the
bosom of a convent, found its echo in a thousand voices;
and that which men would have desired to confine within
the walls of a cloister, went forth and took a bodily form in
the very midst of the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MELANCTHON'S PROPOSITION.</div>

<p>Rumours of the dissensions among the friars soon spread
through the town. The citizens and students of the university
took part, some with, some against the mass. The
elector's court was troubled. Frederick in surprise sent his
chancellor Pontanus to Wittemberg with orders to reduce the
monks to obedience, by putting them, if necessary, on bread
and water;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and on the 12th of October, at seven in the
morning, a deputation from the professors, of which Melancthon
formed a part, visited the convent, exhorting the
brothers to attempt no innovations,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> or at least to wait a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
little longer. Upon this all their zeal revived: as they were
unanimous in their faith, except the prior who combated
them, they appealed to Scripture, to the understanding of
believers, and to the conscience of the theologians; and two
days after handed in a written declaration.</p>

<p>The doctors now examined the question more closely, and
found that the monks had truth on their side. They had
gone to convince, and were convinced themselves. What
ought they to do? their consciences cried aloud; their anxiety
kept increasing: at last, after long hesitation, they formed a
courageous resolution.</p>

<p>On the 20th of October, the university made their report
to the elector. "Let your electoral highness," said they,
after setting forth the errors of the mass, "put an end to
every abuse, lest Christ in the day of judgment should rebuke
us as he did the people of Capernaum."</p>

<p>Thus it is no longer a few obscure monks who are speaking;
it is that university which for several years has been
hailed by all the wise as the school of the nation; and the
very means employed to check the Reformation are those
which will now contribute to its extension.</p>

<p>Melancthon, with that boldness which he carried into
learning, published fifty-five propositions calculated to enlighten
men's minds.</p>

<p>"Just as, looking at a cross," said he, "is not performing
a good work, but simply contemplating a sign that reminds
us of Christ's death;</p>

<p>"Just as looking at the sun is not performing a good
work, but simply contemplating a sign that reminds us of
Christ and of his Gospel;</p>

<p>"So, partaking of the Lord's Supper is not performing a
good work, but simply making use of a sign that reminds us
of the grace that has been given us through Christ.</p>

<p>"But here is the difference, namely, that the symbols invented
by men simply remind us of what they signify;
while the signs given us by God, not only remind us of the
things themselves, but assure our hearts of the will of
God.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE ELECTOR.</div>

<p>"As the sight of a cross does not justify, so the mass does
not justify.</p>

<p>"As the sight of a cross is not a sacrifice either for our
sins or for the sins of others, so the mass is not a sacrifice.</p>

<p>"There is but one sacrifice,&mdash;but one satisfaction,&mdash;Jesus
Christ. Besides him, there is none.</p>

<p>"Let such bishops as do not oppose the impiety of the
mass be accursed."</p>

<p>Thus spoke the pious and gentle Philip.</p>

<p>The elector was amazed. He had desired to reduce some
young friars,&mdash;and now the whole university, Melancthon
himself, rose in their defence. To wait seemed to him in all
things the surest means of success. He did not like sudden
reforms, and desired that every opinion should make its way
without obstruction. "Time alone," thought he, "clears
up all things and brings them to maturity." And yet in
spite of him the Reformation was advancing with hasty
steps, and threatened to carry everything along with it.
Frederick made every exertion to arrest its progress. His
authority, the influence of his character, the reasons that
appeared to him the most convincing, were all set in operation.
"Do not be too hasty," said he to the theologians;
"your number is too small to carry such a reform. If it is
based upon the Gospel, others will discover it also, and you
will put an end to abuses with the aid of the whole Church.
Talk, debate, preach on these matters as much as you like,
but keep up the ancient usages."</p>

<p>Such was the battle fought on the subject of the mass.
The monks had bravely led the assault; the theologians, undecided
for a moment, had soon come to their support. The
prince and his ministers alone defended the place. It has
been asserted that the Reformation was accomplished by the
power and authority of the elector; but far from that, the
assailants shrunk back at the sound of his voice, and the
mass was saved for a few days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MONACHISM ATTACKED.</div>

<p>The heat of the attack had been already directed against
another point. Friar Gabriel still continued his heart-stirring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
sermons in the church of the Augustines. Monachism
was now the object of his reiterated blows; if the
mass was the stronghold of the Roman doctrines, the monastic
orders were the support of her hierarchy. These, then,
were the two first positions that must be carried.</p>

<p>"No one," said Gabriel, according to the prior's report,
"no dweller in the convents keeps the commandments of
God; no one can be saved under a cowl;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> every man that
enters a cloister enters it in the name of the devil. The
vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, are contrary to the
Gospel."</p>

<p>This extraordinary language was reported to the prior,
who avoided going to church for fear he should hear it.</p>

<p>"Gabriel," said they, "desires that every exertion should
be made to empty the cloisters. He says if a monk is met
in the streets, the people should pull him by the frock and
laugh at him; and that if they cannot be driven out of the
convents by ridicule, they should be expelled by force. Break
open, pull down, utterly destroy the monasteries (says he), so
that not a single trace of them may remain; and that not
one of those stones that have contributed to shelter so much
sloth and superstition may be found in the spot they so long
occupied."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The friars were astonished; their consciences told them
that Gabriel's words were but too true, that a monkish life
was not in conformity with the will of God, and that no one
could dispose of their persons better than themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FERMENT IN WITTEMBERG.</div>

<p>Thirteen Augustines quitted the convent together, and
laying aside the costume of their order, assumed a lay dress.
Those who possessed any learning attended the lectures of
the university, in order one day to be serviceable to the Church;
and those whose minds were uncultivated, endeavoured to
gain a livelihood by the work of their own hands, according
to the injunctions of the apostle, and the example of the
good citizens of Wittemberg.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> One of them, who understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the business of a joiner, applied for the freedom of the city,
and resolved to take a wife.</p>

<p>If Luther's entry into the Augustine convent at Erfurth
had been the germ of the Reformation, the departure of
these thirteen monks from the convent of the Augustines
at Wittemberg was the signal of its entering into possession
of Christendom. For thirty years past Erasmus had been
unveiling the uselessness, the folly, and the vices of the
monks; and all Europe laughed and grew angry with him:
but sarcasm was required no longer. Thirteen high-minded
and bold men returned into the midst of the world, to render
themselves profitable to society and fulfil the commandments
of God. Feldkirchen's marriage had been the first defeat of
the hierarchy; the emancipation of these thirteen Augustines
was the second. Monachism, which had arisen at the
time when the Church entered upon its period of enslavement
and error, was destined to fall at the dawning of liberty
and truth.</p>

<p>This daring step excited universal ferment in Wittemberg.
Admiration was felt towards those men who thus came to
take their part in the general labours, and they were received
as brethren. At the same time a few outcries were
heard against those who persisted in remaining lazily sheltered
behind the walls of their monastery. The monks who remained
faithful to their prior trembled in their cells; and
the latter, carried away by the general movement, stopped
the celebration of the low masses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISTURBANCES&mdash;AUGUSTINE CHAPTER.</div>

<p>The smallest concession in so critical a moment of
necessity precipitated the course of events. The prior's
order created a great sensation in the town and university,
and produced a sudden explosion. Among the students
and citizens of Wittemberg were found some of those turbulent
men whom the least excitement arouses and hurries
into criminal disorders. They were exasperated at the idea
of the low masses, which even the superstitious prior had suspended,
still being said in the parish church; and on Tuesday
the 3d of December, as the mass was about to be read,
they ran up to the altars, took away the books, and drove
the priests out of the chapel. The council and university<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
were annoyed, and met to punish the authors of these misdeeds.
But the passions once aroused are not easily quelled.
The Cordeliers had not taken part in this movement of the
Augustines. On the following day, the students posted a
threatening placard on the gates of their convent; after
that forty students entered their church, and although they
refrained from violence, they ridiculed the monks, so that
the latter dared not say mass except in the choir. Towards
evening the fathers were told to be upon their guard: "The
students (it was said) are resolved to attack the monastery!"
The frightened religioners, not knowing how to shelter
themselves from these real or supposed attacks, hastily
besought the council to protect them; a guard of soldiers
was sent, but the enemy did not appear. The university
caused the students who had taken part in these disturbances
to be arrested. It was discovered that some were
from Erfurth, where they had become notorious for their insubordination.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
The penalties of the university were inflicted
upon them.</p>

<p>And yet the necessity was felt of inquiring carefully into the
lawfulness of monastic vows. A chapter of Augustine monks
from Misnia and Thuringia assembled at Wittemberg in
the month of December. They came to the same opinion
as Luther. On the one hand they declared that monastic
vows were not criminal, but on the other that they were
not obligatory. "In Christ," said they, "there is neither
layman nor monk; each one is at liberty to quit the monastery
or to stay in it. Let him who goes forth beware
lest he abuse his liberty; let him who remains obey his
superiors, but through love." They next abolished mendicancy
and the saying of masses for money; they also decreed
that the best instructed among them should devote themselves
to the teaching of the Word of God, and that the
rest should support their brethren by the work of their own
hands.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">CARLSTADT AND THE MASS.</div>

<p>Thus the question of vows appeared settled; but that of
the mass was undecided. The elector still resisted the torrent,
and protected an institution which he saw standing in
all Christendom. The orders of so indulgent a prince could
not long restrain the public feeling. Carlstadt's head in
particular was turning in the midst of the general ferment.
Zealous, upright, and bold, ready, like Luther, to sacrifice
everything for the truth, he was inferior to the reformer in
wisdom and moderation; he was not entirely exempt from
vain-glory, and with a disposition inclined to examine
matters to the bottom, he was defective in judgment and
in clearness of ideas. Luther had dragged him from the
mire of scholasticism, and directed him to the study of Scripture;
but Carlstadt had not acknowledged with his friend the
all-sufficiency of the Word of God. Accordingly he was
often seen adopting the most singular interpretations. So
long as Luther was at his side, the superiority of the master
kept the scholar within due bounds. But now Carlstadt
was free. In the university, in the church, everywhere in
Wittemberg, this little dark-featured man, who had never
excelled in eloquence, might be heard proclaiming with
great fervour ideas that were sometimes profound, but often
enthusiastic and exaggerated. "What madness," exclaimed
he, "to think that one must leave the Reformation to God's
working alone! A new order of things is beginning. The
hand of man should interfere. Woe be to him who lags behind,
and does not climb the breach in the cause of the
Almighty."</p>

<p>The archdeacon's language communicated to others the
impatience he felt himself. "All that the popes have ordained
is impious," said certain upright and sincere men
who followed his example. "Let us not become partakers
in those abominations by allowing them to subsist any
longer. What is condemned by the Word of God ought
to be put down in the whole of Christendom, whatever may
be the ordinances of men. If the heads of the State and of
the Church will not do their duty, let us do ours. Let us
renounce all negotiations, conferences, theses, and disputations,
and let us apply the effectual remedy to so many evils.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
"We need a second Elijah to throw down the altars of
Baal."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LORD'S SUPPER.</div>

<p>The re-establishment of the Lord's Supper, in this moment
of ferment and enthusiasm, unquestionably could not present
the solemnity and holiness of its first institution by the
Son of God, on the eve of his death, and almost at the foot
of the cross. But if God now made use of weak and perhaps
passionate men, it was nevertheless his hand that revived
in the Church the feast of his love.</p>

<p>In the previous October, Carlstadt had already celebrated
the Lord's Supper in private with twelve of his friends, in
accordance with Christ's institution. On the Sunday before
Christmas he gave out from the pulpit that on the day of
our Lord's circumcision (the first day of the year) he would
distribute the eucharist in both kinds (bread and wine) to
all who presented themselves at the altar; that he would
omit all useless forms,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and in celebrating this mass would
wear neither cope nor chasuble.</p>

<p>The affrighted council entreated the councillor Beyer to
prevent such a flagrant irregularity; and upon this Carlstadt
resolved not to wait until the appointed day. On Christmas-day,
1521, he preached in the parish church on the necessity
of quitting the mass and receiving the sacrament in both
kinds. After the sermon he went to the altar; pronounced
the words of consecration in German, and then turning towards
the attentive people, said with a solemn voice:
"Whosoever feels the burden of his sins, and hungers and
thirsts for the grace of God, let him come and receive the
body and blood of our Lord."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> And then, without elevating
the host, he distributed the bread and wine to all, saying:
"This is the cup of my blood, the blood of the new and everlasting
Covenant."</p>

<div class="sidenote">IMPORTANCE OF THE MASS.</div>

<p>Antagonist sentiments prevailed in the assembly. Some,
feeling that a new grace from God had been given to the
Church, approached the altar in silence and emotion. Others,
attracted chiefly by the novelty, drew nigh with a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
sense of agitation and impatience. Five communicants
alone had presented themselves in the confessional: the
rest simply took part in the public confession of sins.
Carlstadt gave a public absolution to all, imposing on
them no other penance than this: "Sin no more." They
finished by singing the <i>Agnus Dei</i>.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>No one opposed Carlstadt; these reforms had already obtained
general assent. The archdeacon administered the Lord's
Supper again on New Year's day, and on the Sunday following,
and from that time it was regularly celebrated.
Einsidlen, one of the elector's councillors, having reproached
Carlstadt with seeking his own glory rather than the salvation
of his hearers: "Mighty lord," replied he, "there is no
form of death that can make me withdraw from Scripture.
The Word has come upon me with such promptitude......Woe
be to me if I preach it not!"<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Shortly after, Carlstadt
married.</p>

<p>In the month of January 1522, the council and university
of Wittemberg regulated the celebration of the Lord's Supper
according to the new ritual. They were, at the same
time, engaged on the means of reviving the moral influence
of religion; for the Reformation was destined to restore
simultaneously faith, worship, and morality. It was decreed
not to tolerate mendicants, whether they were begging friars
or not; and that in every street there should be some pious
man commissioned to take care of the poor, and summon
open sinners before the university and the council.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">IN THE ROMISH SYSTEM.</div>

<p>Thus fell the mass&mdash;the principal bulwark of Rome; thus
the Reformation passed from simple teaching into public
worship. For three centuries the mass and transubstantiation
had been peremptorily established.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> From that period
everything in the Church had taken a new direction; all
things tended to the glory of man and the worship of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
priest. The Holy Sacrament had been adored; festivals had
been instituted in honour of the sublimest of miracles; the
adoration of Mary had acquired a high importance; the
priest who, on his consecration, received the wonderful power
of "making the body of Christ," had been separated from
the laity, and had become, according to Thomas Aquinas, a
mediator between God and man;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> celibacy had been proclaimed
as an inviolable law; auricular confession had been
enforced upon the people, and the cup denied them; for how
could humble laymen be placed in the same rank as priests
invested with the most august ministry? The mass was
an insult to the Son of God: it was opposed to the perfect
grace of His cross, and the spotless glory of His everlasting
kingdom. But if it lowered the Saviour, it exalted
the priest, whom it invested with the unparalleled power of
reproducing in his hand, and at his will, the Sovereign Creator.
From that time the Church seemed to exist not to
preach the Gospel, but simply to reproduce Christ bodily.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
The Roman pontiff, whose humblest servants created at
pleasure the body of God himself, sat as God in the temple
of God, and claimed a spiritual treasure, from which he drew
at will indulgences for the pardon of souls.</p>

<p>Such were the gross errors which, for three centuries, had
been imposed on the Church in conjunction with the mass.
When the Reformation abolished this institution of man, it
abolished these abuses also. The step taken by the archdeacon
of Wittemberg was therefore one of a very extended
range. The splendid festivals that used to amuse the people,
the worship of the Virgin, the pride of the priesthood, the
authority of the pope&mdash;all tottered with the mass. The
glory was withdrawn from the priests, to return to Jesus
Christ, and the Reformation took an immense stride in advance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">False Reform&mdash;The New Prophets&mdash;The Prophets at Wittemberg&mdash;Melancthon&mdash;The
Elector&mdash;Luther&mdash;Carlstadt and the Images&mdash;Disturbances&mdash;Luther
is called for&mdash;He does not hesitate&mdash;Dangers.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">FALSE REFORM.</div>

<p>Prejudiced men might have seen nothing in the work that
was going on but the effects of an empty enthusiasm. The
very facts were to prove the contrary, and demonstrate that
there is a wide gulf between a Reformation based on the
Word of God and a fanatical excitement.</p>

<p>Whenever a great religious ferment takes place in the
Church, some impure elements always appear with the
manifestations of truth. We see the rise of one or more
false reforms proceeding from man, and which serve as a testimony
or countersign to the real reform. Thus many false
messiahs in the time of Christ testified that the real Messiah
had appeared. The Reformation of the sixteenth century
could not be accomplished without presenting a similar phenomenon.
In the small town of Zwickau it was first manifested.</p>

<p>In that place there lived a few men who, agitated by the
great events that were then stirring all Christendom, aspired
at direct revelations from the Deity, instead of meekly desiring
sanctification of heart, and who asserted that they were
called to complete the Reformation so feebly sketched out
by Luther. "What is the use," said they, "of clinging so
closely to the Bible? The Bible! always the Bible! Can the
Bible preach to us? Is it sufficient for our instruction? If
God had designed to instruct us by a book, would he not
have sent us a Bible from heaven? It is by the Spirit alone
that we can be enlightened. God himself speaks to us.
God himself reveals to us what we should do, and what we
should preach." Thus did these fanatics, like the adherents
of Rome, attack the fundamental principle on which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
entire Reformation is founded&mdash;the all-sufficiency of the Word
of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NEW PROPHETS&mdash;THEIR PREACHING.</div>

<p>A simple clothier, Nicholas Storch by name, announced
that the angel Gabriel had appeared to him during the night,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
and that after communicating matters which he could not yet
reveal, said to him: "Thou shalt sit on my throne." A former
student of Wittemberg, one Mark Stubner, joined Storch,
and immediately forsook his studies; for he had received direct
from God (said he) the gift of interpreting the Holy Scriptures.
Another weaver, Mark Thomas, added to their number;
and a new adept, Thomas Munzer, a man of fanatical
character, gave a regular organization to this rising sect.
Storch, desirous of following Christ's example, selected from
among his followers twelve apostles and seventy-two disciples.
All loudly declared, as a sect in our days has done,
that apostles and prophets were at length restored to the
Church of God.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>The new prophets, pretending to walk in the footsteps of
those of old, began to proclaim their mission: "Woe! woe!"
said they; "a Church governed by men so corrupt as the
bishops cannot be the Church of Christ. The impious rulers
of Christendom will be overthrown. In five, six, or seven
years, a universal desolation will come upon the world. The
Turk will seize upon Germany; all the priests will be put
to death, even those who are married. No ungodly man, no
sinner will remain alive; and after the earth has been purified
by blood, God will then set up a kingdom; Storch will
be put in possession of the supreme authority, and commit
the government of the nations to the saints.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Then there
will be one only faith, one only baptism. The day of the
Lord is at hand, and the end of the world draweth nigh.
Woe! woe! woe!" Then declaring that infant baptism was
valueless, the new prophets called upon all men to come and
receive from their hands the true baptism, as a sign of their
introduction into the new Church of God.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE NEW PROPHETS.</div>

<p>This language made a deep impression on the people.
Many pious souls were stirred by the thought that prophets
were again restored to the Church, and all those who were
fond of the marvellous threw themselves into the arms of
the extravagants of Zwickau.</p>

<p>But scarcely had this old delusion, which had already appeared
in the days of Montanism and in the Middle Ages,
found followers, when it met with a powerful antagonist in
the Reformation. Nicholas Hausmann, of whom Luther
gave this powerful testimony, "What we preach, he practises,"<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
was pastor of Zwickau. This good man did not
allow himself to be misled by the pretensions of the false
prophets. He checked the innovations that Storch and his
followers desired to introduce, and his two deacons acted in
unison with him. The fanatics, rejected by the ministers of
the Church, fell into another extravagance. They formed
meetings in which revolutionary doctrines were professed.
The people were agitated, and disturbances broke out. A
priest, carrying the host, was pelted with stones;<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> the civil
authority interfered, and cast the ringleaders into prison.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
Exasperated by this proceeding, and eager to vindicate themselves
and to obtain redress, Storch, Mark Thomas, and
Stubner repaired to Wittemberg.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>They arrived there on the 27th of December 1521.
Storch led the way with the gait and bearing of a trooper.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
Mark Thomas and Stubner followed him. The disorder then
prevailing in Wittemberg was favourable to their designs.
The youths of the academy and the citizens, already profoundly
agitated and in a state of excitement, were a soil
well fitted to receive these new prophets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NEW PROPHETS AT WITTEMBERG.</div>

<p>Thinking themselves sure of support, they immediately
called on the professors of the university, in order to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
their sanction. "We are sent by God to instruct the people,"
said they. "We have held familiar conversations with the
Lord; we know what will happen;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> in a word, we are apostles
and prophets, and appeal to Dr. Luther." This strange language
astonished the professors.</p>

<p>"Who has commissioned you to preach?" asked Melancthon
of his old pupil Stubner, whom he received into his
house. "The Lord our God."&mdash;"Have you written any
books?"&mdash;"The Lord our God has forbidden me to do so."
Melancthon was agitated: he grew alarmed and astonished.</p>

<p>"There are, indeed, extraordinary spirits in these men,"
said he; "but what spirits?......Luther alone can decide. On
the one hand, let us beware of quenching the Spirit of God,
and, on the other, of being led astray by the spirit of Satan."</p>

<p>Storch, being of a restless disposition, soon quitted Wittemberg.
Stubner remained. Animated by an eager spirit of proselytism,
he went through the city, speaking now to one, then
to another; and many acknowledged him as a prophet from
God. He addressed himself more particularly to a Swabian
named Cellarius, a friend of Melancthon's, who kept a school
in which he used to instruct a great number of young people,
and who soon fully acknowledged the mission of the new
prophets.</p>

<p>Melancthon now became still more perplexed and uneasy.
It was not so much the visions of the Zwickau prophets that
disturbed him, as their new doctrine on baptism. It seemed
to him conformable with reason, and he thought that it was
deserving examination; "for" said he, "we must neither
admit nor reject any thing lightly."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Such is the spirit of the Reformation. Melancthon's hesitation
and anxiety are a proof of the uprightness of his heart,
more honourable to him, perhaps, than any systematic opposition
would have been.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER ON THE NEW PROPHETS.</div>

<p>The elector himself, whom Melancthon styled "the lamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of Israel,"<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> hesitated. Prophets and apostles in the electorate
of Saxony as in Jerusalem of old! "This is a great
matter," said he; "and as a layman, I cannot understand it.
But rather than fight against God, I would take a staff in my
hand, and descend from my throne."</p>

<p>At length he informed the professors, by his councillors,
that they had sufficient trouble in hand at Wittemberg;
that in all probability these pretensions of the Zwickau prophets
were only a temptation of the devil; and that the
wisest course, in his opinion, would be to let the matter drop
of itself; nevertheless that, under all circumstances, whenever
his highness should clearly perceive God's will, he would
take counsel of neither brother nor mother, and that he was
ready to suffer everything in the cause of truth.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Luther in the Wartburg was apprized of the agitation
prevailing in the court and at Wittemberg. Strange men
had appeared, and the source whence their mission proceeded
was unknown. He saw immediately that God had
permitted these afflicting events to humble his servants, and
to excite them by trials to strive more earnestly after sanctification.</p>

<p>"Your electoral grace," wrote he to Frederick, "has for
many years been collecting relics from every country. God
has satisfied your desire, and has sent you, without cost or
trouble, a whole <i>cross</i>, with nails, spears, and scourges......Health
and prosperity to the new relic!......Only let your
highness fearlessly stretch out your arm, and suffer the nails
to enter your flesh!......I always expected that Satan would
send us this plague."</p>

<p>But at the same time nothing appeared to him more
urgent than to secure for others the liberty that he claimed
for himself. He had not two weights and two measures.
"Beware of throwing them into prison," wrote he to Spalatin.
"Let not the prince dip his hand in the blood of these
new prophets."<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Luther went far beyond his age, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
beyond many other reformers, on the subject of religious
liberty.</p>

<p>Circumstances were becoming every day more serious in
Wittemberg.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CARLSTADT AND THE IMAGES.</div>

<p>Carlstadt rejected many of the doctrines of the new prophets,
and particularly their sentiments on baptism; but
there is a contagion in religious enthusiasm that a head
like his could not easily resist. From the arrival of the
men of Zwickau in Wittemberg, Carlstadt accelerated his
movements in the direction of violent reforms. "We must
fall upon every ungodly practice, and overthrow them all
in a day," said he.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> He brought together all the passages
of Scripture against images, and inveighed with increasing
energy against the idolatry of Rome. "They fall down&mdash;they
crawl before these idols," exclaimed he; "they burn
tapers before them, and make them offerings......Let us
arise and tear them from the altars!"</p>

<p>These words were not uttered in vain before the people.
They entered the churches, carried away the images, broke
them in pieces, and burnt them.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> It would have been better
to wait until their abolition had been legally proclaimed;
but some thought that the caution of the chiefs would
compromise the Reformation itself.</p>

<p>To judge by the language of these enthusiasts, there were
no true Christians in Wittemberg save those who went not
to confession, who attacked the priests, and who ate meat on
fast days. If any one was suspected of not rejecting all the
rites of the Church as an invention of the devil, he was set
down as a worshipper of Baal. "We must form a Church,"
cried they, "composed of saints only!"</p>

<p>The citizens of Wittemberg laid before the council certain
articles which it was forced to accept. Many of the articles
were conformable to evangelical morals. They required
more particularly that all houses of public amusement
should be closed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VANDALISM&mdash;MOURNFUL CONSEQUENCES.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>But Carlstadt soon went still farther: he began to despise
learning; and the old professor was heard from his chair
advising his pupils to return home, to take up the spade, to
guide the plough, and quietly cultivate the earth, because
man was to eat bread in the sweat of his brow. George
Mohr, the master of the boys' school at Wittemberg, led
away by the same fanaticism, called to the assembled citizens
from the window of his schoolroom to come and take away
their children. Why should they study, since Storch and
Stubner had never been at the university, and yet they were
prophets?......A mechanic, therefore, was as good as all the
doctors in the world, and perhaps better, to preach the Gospel.</p>

<p>Thus arose doctrines in direct opposition to the Reformation,
which had been prepared by the revival of letters. It
was with the weapon of theological learning that Luther
had attacked Rome; and the enthusiasts of Wittemberg,
like the fanatical monks with whom Erasmus and Reuchlin
had contended, presumed to trample all human learning
under foot. If this vandalism succeeded in holding its
ground, the hopes of the world were lost; and another irruption
of barbarians would extinguish the light that God
had kindled in Christendom.</p>

<p>The results of these strange discourses soon showed themselves.
Men's minds were prejudiced, agitated, diverted
from the Gospel; the university became disorganized; the
demoralized students broke the bonds of discipline and dispersed;
and the governments of Germany recalled their subjects.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
Thus the men who desired to reform and vivify every
thing, were on the point of ruining all.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> One struggle more
(exclaimed the friends of Rome, who on all sides were regaining
their confidence),&mdash;one last struggle, and all will be
ours!</p>

<div class="sidenote">A REMEDY WANTED&mdash;LUTHER CALLED FOR.</div>

<p>Promptly to check the excesses of these fanatics was the
only means of saving the Reformation. But who could do
it? Melancthon? He was too young, too weak, too much
agitated himself by these strange apparitions. The elector?
He was the most pacific man of his age. To build castles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
at Altenburg, Weimar, Lochau, and Coburg; to adorn
churches with the beautiful pictures of Lucas Cranach; to
improve the singing in the chapels; to advance the prosperity
of his university; to promote the happiness of his subjects;
to stop in the midst of the children whom he met playing
in the streets, and give them little presents:&mdash;such were
the gentle occupations of his life. And now in his advanced
age, would he contend with fanatics&mdash;would he oppose
violence to violence? How could the good and pious Frederick
make up his mind to this?</p>

<p>The disease continued to spread, and no one stood forward
to check it. Luther was far from Wittemberg. Confusion
and ruin had taken hold of the city. The Reformation
had seen an enemy spring from its own bosom more
formidable than popes and emperors. It was on the very
verge of the abyss.</p>

<p>Luther! Luther! was the general and unanimous cry at
Wittemberg. The citizens called for him earnestly; the
professors desired his advice; the prophets themselves appealed
to him. All entreated him to return.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>We may imagine what was passing in the reformer's
mind. All the terrors of Rome were nothing in comparison
with what now wrung his heart. It is from the very midst
of the Reformation that its enemies have gone forth. It is
preying upon its own vitals; and that doctrine which alone
brought peace to his troubled heart becomes the occasion of
fatal disturbances to the Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER DOES NOT HESITATE.</div>

<p>"If I knew," he had once said, "that my doctrine injured
one man, one single man, however lowly and obscure (which
it cannot, for it is the Gospel itself), I would rather die ten
times than not retract it."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> And now a whole city, and
that city Wittemberg, is falling into disorder! True, his
doctrine has no share in this; but from every quarter of
Germany voices are heard accusing him of it. Pains more
keen than he had ever felt before assail him now, and new
temptations agitate him. "Can such then be the end of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
great work of the Reformation?" said he to himself. Impossible!&mdash;he
rejects these doubts. God has begun,......God will
perfect the work. "I creep in deep humility to the grace of
the Lord,"<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> exclaimed he, "and beseech him that his name
may remain attached to this work; and that if anything impure
be mixed up with it, he will remember that I am a sinful
man."</p>

<p>The news communicated to Luther of the inspiration of
these new prophets, and of their sublime interviews with God,
did not stagger him one moment. He knew the depth, the
anguish, the humiliation of the spiritual life: at Erfurth and
Wittemberg he had made trial of the power of God, which did
not so easily permit him to believe that God appeared to his
creatures and conversed with them. "Ask these prophets,"
wrote he to Melancthon, "whether they have felt those
spiritual torments, those creations of God, that death and
hell which accompany a real regeneration......<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> And if
they speak to you only of agreeable things, of tranquil impressions,
of devotion and piety, as they say, do not believe
them, although they should pretend to have been transported
to the third heaven. Before Christ could attain his glory, he
was compelled to suffer death; and in like manner the believer
must go through the bitterness of sin before he can
obtain peace. Do you desire to know the time, place, and
manner in which God talks with men? Listen: <i>As a lion
so hath he broken all my bones: I am cast out from before
his face, and my soul is abased even to the gates of hell</i>......No!
The Divine Majesty (as they pretend) does not speak
directly, so that men may see it; for <i>no man can see my face
and live</i>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S DANGER.</div>

<p>But his firm conviction of the delusion under which these
prophets were labouring, served but to augment Luther's
grief. Has the great truth of salvation by grace so quickly
lost its charms that men turn aside from it to follow fables?
He begins to feel that the work is not so easy as he had
thought at first. He stumbles at the first stone that the deceitfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of the human heart had placed in his path; he is
bowed down by grief and anxiety. He resolves, at the hazard
of his life, to remove it out of the way of his people, and decides
on returning to Wittemberg.</p>

<p>At that time he was threatened by imminent dangers.
The enemies of the Reformation fancied themselves on the
very eve of destroying it. George of Saxony, equally indisposed
towards Rome and Wittemberg, had written, as early as
the 16th of October 1521, to Duke John, the elector's brother,
to draw him over to the side of the enemies of the Reformation.
"Some," said he, "deny that the soul is immortal. Others (and
these are monks!) attach bells to swine and set them to drag
the relics of St. Anthony through the streets, and then throw
them into the mire.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> All this is the fruit of Luther's teaching!
Entreat your brother the elector either to punish the
ungodly authors of these innovations, or at least publicly to
declare his opinion of them. Our changing beard and hair
remind us that we have reached the latter portion of our
course, and urge us to put an end to such great evils."</p>

<p>After this George departed to take his seat in the imperial
government at Nuremberg. He had scarcely arrived when
he made every exertion to urge it to adopt measures of severity.
In effect, on the 21st of January, this body passed an
edict, in which it complained bitterly that the priests said
mass without being robed in their sacerdotal garments, consecrated
the sacrament in German, administered it without
having received the requisite confession from the communicants,
placed it in the hands of laymen,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and were not even
careful to ascertain that those who stood forward to receive
it were fasting.</p>

<p>Accordingly the imperial government desired the bishops
to seek out and punish severely all the innovators within
their respective dioceses. The latter hastened to comply
with these orders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEPARTURE FROM THE WARTBURG.</div>

<p>Such was the moment selected by Luther for his reappearance
on the stage. He saw the danger; he foreboded incalculable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
disasters. "Erelong," said he, "there will be a disturbance
in the empire, carrying princes, magistrates, and
bishops before it. The people have eyes: they will not, they
cannot be led by force. All Germany will run blood.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Let

<p>Such were Luther's thoughts; but he beheld a still more
imminent danger. At Wittemberg, the conflagration, far
from dying away, became fiercer every day. From the
heights of the Wartburg, Luther could perceive in the horizon
the frightful gleams, the signal of devastation, shooting
at intervals through the air. Is not he the only one who
can give aid in this extremity? Shall he not throw himself
into the midst of the flames to quench their fury? In vain
his enemies prepare to strike the decisive blow; in vain the
elector entreats him not to leave the Wartburg, and to prepare
his justification against the next diet. He has a more
important task to perform&mdash;to justify the Gospel itself.
"More serious intelligence reaches me every day," wrote he.
"I shall set out: circumstances positively require me to
do so."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">NEW POSITION&mdash;LUTHER AND PRIMITIVE CATHOLICITY.</div>

<p>Accordingly, he rose on the 3d of March with the determination
of leaving the Wartburg for ever. He bade adieu
to its time-worn towers and gloomy forests. He passed
beyond those walls where the excommunications of Leo X.
and the sword of Charles V. were unable to reach him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
descended the mountain. The world that lay at his feet,
and in the midst of which he is about to appear again, would
soon perhaps call loudly for his death. But it matters not!
he goes forward rejoicing: for in the name of the Lord he is
returning among his fellow-men.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Time had moved on. Luther was quitting the Wartburg
for a cause very different from that for which he had entered
it. He had gone thither as the assailant of the old tradition
and of the ancient doctors; he left it as the defender of the
doctrine of the apostles against new adversaries. He had
entered it as an innovator, and as an impugner of the ancient
hierarchy; he left it as a conservative and champion of the
faith of Christians. Hitherto Luther had seen but one thing
in his work,&mdash;the triumph of justification by faith; and with
this weapon he had thrown down mighty superstitions. But
if there was a time for destroying, there was also a time for
building up. Beneath those ruins with which his strong
arm had strewn the plain,&mdash;beneath those crumpled letters of
indulgence, those broken tiaras and tattered cowls,&mdash;beneath
so many Roman abuses and errors that lay in confusion upon
the field of battle, he discerned and discovered the primitive
Catholic Church, reappearing still the same, and coming forth
as from a long period of trial, with its unchangeable doctrines
and heavenly accents. He could distinguish it from Rome,
welcoming and embracing it with joy. Luther effected nothing
new in the world, as he has been falsely charged; he
did not raise a building for the future that had no connexion
with the past; he uncovered, he opened to the light of day
the ancient foundations, on which thorns and thistles had
sprung up, and continuing the construction of the temple, he
built simply on the foundations laid by the apostles. Luther
perceived that the ancient and primitive Church of the
apostles must, on the one hand, be restored in opposition to
the Papacy, by which it had been so long oppressed; and on
the other, be defended against enthusiasts and unbelievers,
who pretended to disown it, and who, regardless of all that
God had done in times past, were desirous of beginning an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
entirely new work. Luther was no longer exclusively the
man of one doctrine,&mdash;that of justification,&mdash;although he always
assigned it the highest place; he became the man of
the whole Christian theology; and while he still believed
that the Church was essentially the congregation of saints,
he was careful not to despise the visible Church, and acknowledged
the assembly of the elect as the kingdom of God.
Thus was a great change effected, at this time, in Luther's
heart, in his theology, and in the work of renovation that
God was carrying on in the world. The Roman hierarchy
might perhaps have driven the reformer to extremes; the
sects which then so boldly raised their heads brought him
back to the true path of moderation. The sojourn in the Wartburg
divides the history of the Reformation into two periods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MEETING AT THE BLACK BEAR.</div>

<p>Luther was riding slowly on the road to Wittemberg: it
was already the second day of his journey, and Shrove Tuesday.
Towards evening a terrible storm burst forth, and the
roads were flooded. Two Swiss youths, who were travelling
in the same direction as himself, were hastening onwards to
find a shelter in the city of Jena. They had studied at Basle,
and the celebrity of Wittemberg attracted them to that university.
Travelling on foot, fatigued, and wet through, John
Kessler of St. Gall and his companion quickened their steps.
The city was all in commotion with the amusements of the
carnival; balls, masquerades, and noisy feasting engrossed
the people of Jena; and when the two travellers arrived,
they could find no room at any of the inns. At last they
were directed to the <i>Black Bear</i>, outside the city gates. Dejected
and harassed, they repaired thither slowly. The landlord
received them kindly.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> They took their seats near the
open door of the public room, ashamed of the state in which the
storm had placed them, and not daring to go in. At one of
the tables sat a solitary man in a knight's dress, wearing a
red cap on his head and breeches over which fell the skirts
of his doublet; his right hand rested on the pommel of his
sword, his left grasped the hilt; and before him lay an open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
book, which he appeared to be reading with great attention.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
At the noise made by the entrance of these two
young men, he raised his head, saluted them affably, and
invited them to come and sit at his table; then presenting
them with a glass of beer, and alluding to their accent,
he said: "You are Swiss, I perceive; but from what canton?"&mdash;"From
St. Gall."&mdash;"If you are going to Wittemberg,
you will there meet with a fellow-countryman, Doctor
Schurff."&mdash;Encouraged by this kind reception, they added:
"Sir, could you inform us where Martin Luther is at present?"&mdash;"I
know for certain," replied the knight, "that he is
not at Wittemberg; but he will be there shortly. Philip
Melancthon is there. Study Greek and Hebrew, that you
may clearly understand the Holy Scriptures."&mdash;"If God
spare our lives," observed one of the young men, "we will
not return home without having seen and heard Doctor
Luther; for it is on his account that we have undertaken
this long journey. We know that he desires to abolish the
priesthood and the mass; and as our parents destined us to
the priesthood from our infancy, we should like to know
clearly on what grounds he rests his proposition." The
knight was silent for a moment, and then resumed: "Where
have you been studying hitherto?"&mdash;"At Basle."&mdash;"Is
Erasmus of Rotterdam still there? what is he doing?"
They replied to his questions, and there was another pause.
The two Swiss knew not what to think. "Is it not strange,"
thought they, "that this knight talks to us of Schurff, Melancthon,
and Erasmus, and on the necessity of learning
Greek and Hebrew."&mdash;"My dear friends," said the unknown
suddenly, "what do they think of Luther in Switzerland?"&mdash;"Sir,"
replied Kessler, "opinions are very divided about
him there as everywhere else. Some cannot extol him
enough; and others condemn him as an abominable heretic."&mdash;"Ha!
the priests, no doubt," said the stranger.</p>

<p>The knight's cordiality had put the students at their ease.
They longed to know what book he was reading at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
moment of their arrival. The knight had closed it, and
placed it by his side. At last Kessler's companion ventured
to take it up. To the great astonishment of the two young
men, it was the Hebrew Psalter! The student laid it down
immediately, and as if to divert attention from the liberty he
had taken, said: "I would willingly give one of my fingers
to know that language."&mdash;"You will attain your wish," said
the stranger, "if you will only take the trouble to learn it."</p>

<p>A few minutes after, Kessler heard the landlord calling
him; the poor Swiss youth feared something had gone
wrong; but the host whispered to him: "I perceive that
you have a great desire to see and hear Luther; well! it is
he who is seated beside you." Kessler took this for a joke,
and said: "Mr. Landlord, you want to make a fool of me."&mdash;"It
is he in very truth," replied the host; "but do not let
him see that you know him." Kessler made no answer, but
returned into the room and took his seat at the table, burning
to repeat to his comrade what he had just heard. But
how could he manage it? At last he thought of leaning
forward, as if he were looking towards the door, and then
whispered into his friend's ear: "The landlord assures me
that this man is Luther."&mdash;"Perhaps he said Hütten," replied
his comrade; "you did not hear him distinctly."&mdash;"It
may be so," returned Kessler; "the host said: It is
Hütten; the two names are pretty much alike, and I mistook
one for the other."</p>

<p>At that moment the noise of horses was heard before the
inn; two merchants, who desired a lodging, entered the
room; they took off their spurs, laid down their cloaks, and
one of them placed beside him on the table an unbound
book, which soon attracted the knight's notice. "What
book is that?" asked he.&mdash;"A commentary on some of the
Gospels and Epistles by Doctor Luther," replied the merchant;
"it is just published."&mdash;"I shall procure it shortly,"
said the knight.</p>

<p>At this moment the host came to announce that supper
was ready. The two students, fearing the expense of such
a meal in company with the knight Ulrich of Hütten and
two wealthy merchants, took the landlord aside, and begged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
him to serve them with something apart. "Come along,
my friends," replied the landlord of the Black Bear; "take
your place at table beside this gentleman; I will charge you
moderately."&mdash;"Come along," said the knight, "I will settle
the score."</p>

<p>During this meal, the stranger knight uttered many simple
and edifying remarks. The students and the merchants were
all ears, and paid more attention to his words than to the
dishes set before them. "Luther must either be an angel
from heaven or a devil from hell," said one of the merchants
in course of conversation; "I would readily give ten florins
if I could meet Luther and confess to him."</p>

<p>When supper was over, the merchants left the table;
the two Swiss remained alone with the knight, who, taking
a large glass of beer, rose and said solemnly, after the
manner of the country: "Swiss, one glass more for thanks."
As Kessler was about to take the glass, the unknown set it
down again, and offered him one filled with wine, saying:
"You are not accustomed to beer."</p>

<p>He then arose, flung a military cloak over his shoulders,
and extending his hand to the students, said to them:
"When you reach Wittemberg, salute Doctor Schurff on
my part."&mdash;"Most willingly," replied they; "but what name
shall we give?"&mdash;"Tell him simply," added Luther, "He
that is to come salutes you." With these words he quitted
the room, leaving them full of admiration at his kindness and
good nature.</p>

<p>Luther, for it was really he, continued his journey. It
will be remembered that he had been laid under the ban of
the empire; whoever met and recognised him, might seize
him. But at the time when he was engaged in an undertaking
that exposed him to every risk, he was calm and
serene, and conversed cheerfully with those whom he met on
the road.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER TO THE ELECTOR.</div>

<p>It was not that he deceived himself: he saw the future
big with storms. "Satan," said he, "is enraged, and all
around are plotting death and hell.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Nevertheless, I go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
forward, and throw myself in the way of the emperor and of
the pope, having no protector save God in heaven. Power
has been given to all men to kill me wherever they find me.
But Christ is the Lord of all; if it be his will that I be put
to death, so be it!"</p>

<p>On that same day, Ash-Wednesday, Luther reached
Borna, a small town near Leipsic. He felt it his duty
to inform the prince of the bold step he was about to take;
and accordingly alighted at the Guide Hotel and wrote the
following letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Grace and peace from God our Father, and from our
Lord Jesus Christ!</p>

<p>"Most serene Elector, gracious Lord! The events that
have taken place at Wittemberg, to the great reproach of
the Gospel, have caused me such pain that if I were not
confident of the truth of our cause, I should have given way
to despair.</p>

<p>"Your highness knows this, or if not, be it known to you
now, that I received the Gospel not from men but from
heaven, through our Lord Jesus Christ. If I called for discussion,
it was not because I had any doubts of the truth,
but in humility, and in the hope to win over others. But
since my humility is turned against the Gospel, my conscience
compels me now to act otherwise. I have sufficiently given
way to your highness by passing this year in retirement.
The devil knows well that I did so not through fear. I
should have entered Worms had there been as many devils
in the city as tiles on the house-tops. Now Duke George,
with whom your highness frightens me, is yet much less to
be feared than a single devil. If that which is passing
at Wittemberg were taking place at Leipsic (the duke's
residence), I would immediately mount my horse to go
thither, although (may your highness pardon these words)
for nine whole days together it were to rain nothing but
Duke Georges, and each one nine times more furious than
he is. What does he think of in attacking me? Does
he take Christ my Lord for a man of straw?<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> O Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
be pleased to avert the terrible judgment which is impending
over him!</p>

<p>"Be it known to your highness that I am going to Wittemberg
under a protection far higher than that of princes
and electors. I think not of soliciting your highness's
support, and, far from desiring your protection, I would
rather protect you myself. If I knew that your highness
could or would protect me, I would not go to Wittemberg at
all. There is no sword that can further this cause. God
alone must do everything without the help or concurrence of
man. He who has the greatest faith is he who is most able
to protect. But I observe that your highness is still weak
in faith.</p>

<p>"But since your highness desires to know what you have
to do, I will answer with all deference: your highness has
already done too much, and ought to do nothing at all.
God will not and cannot endure either your cares and labours
or mine. Let your highness's conduct be guided by
this.</p>

<p>"As for what concerns me, your highness must act as an
elector; you must let the orders of his imperial majesty take
their course in your towns and rural districts. You must
offer no resistance if men desire to seize or kill me;<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> for no
one should resist dominions except He who has established
them.</p>

<p>"Let your highness leave the gates open, and respect
safe-conducts, if my enemies in person or their envoys come
in search of me into your highness's states. Everything
shall be done without trouble or danger to yourself.</p>

<p>"I have written this letter in haste, that you may not be
made uneasy at hearing of my arrival. I have to do with a
very different man from Duke George. He knows me well,
and I know him pretty well.</p>

<p>"Given at Borna, at the inn of the Guide, this Ash-Wednesday
1522.</p>

<p class="signature">
"Your electoral highness's<br />
"Very humble servant,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Martin Luther</span>."<br />
</p>

<div class="sidenote">RETURN TO WITTEMBERG&mdash;LUTHER'S FRIENDS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>It was thus Luther drew nigh to Wittemberg. He wrote
to his prince, but not to excuse himself. An imperturbable
confidence filled his heart. He saw the hand of God in this
cause, and that was sufficient for him. The heroism of
faith can never be carried farther. One of the editions of
Luther's works has the following remark in the margin of
this letter: "This is a wonderful writing of the third and
last Elias!"<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Luther re-entered Wittemberg on Friday the 7th March,
having been five days on the way from Eisenach. Doctors,
students, and citizens, all broke forth in rejoicings; for they
had recovered the pilot who alone could extricate the vessel
from the reefs among which it was entangled.</p>

<p>The elector, who was at Lockau with his court, felt great
emotion as he read the reformer's letter. He was desirous
of vindicating him before the diet: "Let him address me a
letter," wrote the prince to Schurff, "explaining the motives
of his return to Wittemberg, and let him say also that he
returned without my permission." Luther consented.</p>

<p>"I am ready to incur the displeasure of your highness
and the anger of the whole world," wrote he to the prince.
"Are not the Wittembergers my sheep? Has God not
intrusted them to me? And ought I not, if necessary, to
expose myself to death for their sakes? Besides, I fear to
see a terrible outbreak in Germany by which God will punish
our nation. Let your highness be well assured and doubt
not that the decrees of heaven are very different from those
of Nuremberg."<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> This letter was written on the very day
of Luther's arrival at Wittemberg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S TASK&mdash;INTREPIDITY.</div>

<p>The following day, being the eve of the first Sunday in
Lent, Luther visited Jerome Schurff. Melancthon, Jonas,
Amsdorff, and Augustin Schurff, Jerome's brother, were there
assembled. Luther eagerly questioned them, and they were
informing him of all that had taken place, when two foreign
students were announced, desiring to speak with Dr. Jerome.
On entering this assembly of doctors, the two young men of
St. Gall were at first abashed; but they soon recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
themselves on discovering the knight of the Black Bear
among them. The latter immediately went up to them,
greeted them as old acquaintances, and smiled as he pointed
to one of the doctors: "This is Philip Melancthon, whom I
mentioned to you." The two Swiss remained all day with
the doctors of Wittemberg, in remembrance of the meeting at
Jena.</p>

<p>One great thought absorbed the reformer's mind, and
checked the joy he felt at meeting his friends once more.
Unquestionably the character in which he was now to appear
was obscure; he was about to raise his voice in a small
town of Saxony, and yet his undertaking had all the importance
of an event which was to influence the destinies of
the world. Many nations and many ages were to feel its
effects. It was a question whether that doctrine which he
had derived from the Word of God, and which was ordained
to exert so mighty an influence on the future development
of the human race, would be stronger than the destructive
principles that threatened its existence. It was a question
whether it were possible to reform without destroying, and
clear the way to new developments without annihilating
the old. To silence fanatical men inspired by the energy of
a first enthusiasm; to master an unbridled multitude, to
calm it down, to lead it back to order, peace, and truth; to
break the course of the impetuous torrent which threatened
to overthrow the rising edifice of the Reformation, and to
scatter its ruins far and wide:&mdash;such was the task for which
Luther had returned to Wittemberg. But would his influence
be sufficient for this? The event alone can show.</p>

<p>The reformer's heart shuddered at the thought of the
struggle that awaited him. He raised his head as a lion
provoked to fight shakes his long mane. "We must now
trample Satan under foot, and contend against the angel
of darkness," said he. "If our adversaries do not retire of
their own accord, Christ will know how to compel them.
We who trust in the Lord of life and of death are ourselves
lords of life and of death."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SERMON AT WITTEMBERG.</div>

<p>But at the same time the impetuous reformer, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
restrained by a superior power, refused to employ the anathemas
and thunders of the Word, and became an humble
pastor, a gentle shepherd of souls. "It is with the Word
that we must fight," said he; "by the Word must we overthrow
and destroy what has been set up by violence. I will
not make use of force against the superstitious and unbelieving.
Let him who believeth draw nigh! let him who believeth
not keep afar off! no one must be constrained.
Liberty is the very essence of faith."<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>The next day was Sunday. On that day the doctor,
whom for nearly a year the lofty ramparts of the Wartburg
have concealed from every eye, will reappear before the
people in the pulpit of the church. It was rumoured in
Wittemberg that Luther was come back, that he was going
to preach. This news alone, passing from mouth to mouth,
had already given a powerful diversion to the ideas by
which the people were misled. They are going to see the
hero of Worms. The people crowded together, and were
affected by various emotions. On Sunday morning the church
was filled with an attentive and excited crowd.</p>

<p>Luther divines all the sentiments of his congregation; he
goes up into the pulpit; there he stands in the presence of
the flock that he had once led as a docile sheep, but which
had broken from him like an untamed bull. His language
was simple, noble, yet full of strength and gentleness: one
might have supposed him to be a tender father returning to
his children, inquiring into their conduct, and kindly telling
them what report he had heard about them. He candidly
acknowledged the progress they had made in faith; and by
this means prepared and captivated their minds. He then
continued in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But we need something more than faith; we need
charity. If a man who bears a sword in his hand be alone,
it is of little consequence whether it be sheathed or not; but
if he is in the midst of a crowd, he should act so as to wound
nobody.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARITY&mdash;THE WORD.</div>

<p>"What does a mother do to her infant? At first she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
gives it milk, then some very light food. If she were to
begin by giving it meat and wine, what would be the consequence?......</p>

<p>"So should we act towards our brethren. My friend,
have you been long enough at the breast? It is well! but
permit your brother to drink as long as yourself.</p>

<p>"Observe the sun! He dispenses two things, light and
heat. There is no king so powerful as to bend aside his
rays; they come straight to us; but heat is radiated and
communicated in every direction. Thus faith, like light,
should always be straight and inflexible; but charity, like
heat, should radiate on every side, and bend to all the wants
of our brethren."</p>

<p>Luther having thus prepared his hearers, began to press
them more closely:</p>

<p>"The abolition of the mass, say you, is in conformity with
Scripture: Agreed! But what order, what decency have you
observed? It behoved you to offer up fervent prayers to the
Lord, and apply to the public authority; then might every
man have acknowledged that the thing was of God."</p>

<p>Thus spake Luther. This dauntless man, who at Worms
had withstood the princes of the earth, produced a deep
impression on the minds of his hearers by these words of wisdom
and of peace. Carlstadt and the prophets of Zwickau,
so great and powerful for a few weeks, and who had tyrannized
over and agitated Wittemberg, had shrunk into pigmies
beside the captive of the Wartburg.</p>

<p>"The mass," continued he, "is a bad thing; God is opposed
to it; it ought to be abolished; and I would that
throughout the whole world it were replaced by the Supper
of the Gospel. But let no one be torn from it by force. We
must leave the matter in God's hands. His Word must
act, and not we. And why so, you will ask? Because I do
not hold men's hearts in my hand, as the potter holds the
clay. We have a right to speak; we have not the right to
act. Let us preach: the rest belongs unto God. Were I to
employ force, what should I gain? Grimace, formality, apeings,
human ordinances, and hypocrisy......But there would
be no sincerity of heart, nor faith, nor charity. Where these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
three are wanting, all is wanting, and I would not give a
pear-stalk for such a result.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW THE REFORMATION WAS EFFECTED.</div>

<p>"Our first object must be to win men's hearts; and for
that purpose we must preach the Gospel. To-day the Word
will fall in one heart, to-morrow in another, and it will
operate in such a manner that each one will withdraw from
the mass and abandon it. God does more by his Word
alone than you and I and all the world by our united
strength. God lays hold upon the heart; and when the
heart is taken, all is won.</p>

<p>"I do not say this for the restoration of the mass. Since
it is down, in God's name there let it lie! But should you
have gone to work as you did? Paul, arriving one day in the
powerful city of Athens, found there altars raised to false
gods. He went from one to the other, and observed them
without touching one. But he walked peaceably to the
middle of the market-place, and declared to the people that
all their gods were idols. His language took possession
of their hearts, and the idols fell without Paul's having
touched them.</p>

<p>"I will preach, discuss, and write; but I will constrain
none, for faith is a voluntary act. See what I have done!
I stood up against the pope, indulgences, and papists, but
without violence or tumult. I put forward God's Word;
I preached and wrote&mdash;this was all I did. And yet while I
was asleep, or seated familiarly at table with Amsdorff and
Melancthon, drinking and gossiping over our Wittemberg
beer, the Word that I had preached overthrew popery, so that
neither prince nor emperor has done it so much harm. And
yet I did nothing: the Word alone did all. If I had wished to
appeal to force, the whole of Germany would perhaps have been
deluged with blood. But what would have been the result?
Ruin and desolation both to body and soul. I therefore
kept quiet, and left the Word to run through the world alone.
Do you know what the devil thinks when he sees men resort
to violence to propagate the Gospel through the world?
Seated with folded arms behind the fire of hell, Satan says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
with malignant looks and frightful grin: 'Ah! how wise
these madmen are to play my game!' But when he sees the
Word running and contending alone on the field of battle,
then he is troubled, and his knees knock together; he shudders
and faints with fear."</p>

<div class="sidenote">SATAN&mdash;THE LORD'S SUPPER.</div>

<p>Luther went into the pulpit again on Tuesday; and his
powerful voice resounded once more through the agitated
crowd. He preached again on the five succeeding days.
He took a review of the destruction of images, distinction
of meats, the institution of the Lord's Supper, the restoration
of the cup, the abolition of confession. He showed that these
points were of far less importance than the mass, and that
the originators of the disorders that had taken place in Wittemberg
had grossly abused their liberty. He employed by
turns the language of christian charity and bursts of holy
indignation.</p>

<p>He inveighed more especially against those who partook
thoughtlessly of Christ's Supper. "It is not the outward
manducation that maketh a Christian," said he, "but the
inward and spiritual eating that worketh by faith, and without
which all forms are mere show and grimace. Now this
faith consists in a firm belief that Jesus Christ is the Son of
God; that having taken our sins and iniquities upon himself,
and having borne them on the cross, he is himself their sole
and almighty atonement; that he stands continually before
God, that he reconcileth us with the Father, and that he
hath given us the sacrament of his body to strengthen our
faith in this unspeakable mercy. If I believe in these things,
God is my defender; with him, I brave sin, death, hell, and
devils; they can do me no harm, nor disturb a single hair of
my head. This spiritual bread is the consolation of the
afflicted, health to the sick, life to the dying, food to the
hungry, riches to the poor. He who does not groan under
his sins must not approach that altar: what can he do there?
Ah! let our conscience accuse us, let our hearts be rent in
twain at the thought of our sins, and then we shall not so
presumptuously approach the holy sacrament."</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISCRETION AND COURAGE.</div>

<p>The crowd ceased not to fill the temple; people flocked
from the neighbouring towns to hear the new Elijah. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
others, Capito spent two days at Wittemberg, and heard two
of the doctor's sermons. Never had Luther and Cardinal
Albert's chaplain been so well agreed. Melancthon, the
magistrates, the professors, and all the inhabitants, were delighted.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
Schurff, charmed at the result of so gloomy an
affair, hastened to communicate it to the elector. On Friday
the 15th March, the day on which Luther delivered his sixth
sermon, he wrote: "Oh, what joy has Dr. Martin's return
diffused among us! His words, through Divine mercy, every
day are bringing back our poor misguided people into the
way of truth. It is clear as the sun that the Spirit of God
is in him, and that by His special providence he returned to
Wittemberg."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>In truth, these sermons are models of popular eloquence,
but not of that which in the times of Demosthenes, or even
of Savonarola, fired men's hearts. The task of the Wittemberg
orator was more difficult. It is easier to rouse the fury
of a wild beast than to allay it. Luther had to soothe a
fanaticized multitude, to tame its unbridled passions; and in
this he succeeded. In his eight discourses, the reformer did
not allow one offensive word to escape him against the originators
of these disorders,&mdash;not one unpleasant allusion. But
the greater his moderation, the greater also was his strength;
the more caution he used towards these deluded men, the
more powerful was his vindication of offended truth. How
could the people of Wittemberg resist his powerful eloquence?
Men usually ascribe to timidity, fear, and compromise, those
speeches that advocate moderation. Here there was nothing
of the sort. Luther appeared before the inhabitants of Wittemberg,
braving the excommunication of the pope and the
proscription of the emperor. He had returned in despite of
the prohibition of the elector, who had declared his inability
to defend him. Even at Worms, Luther had not shown so
much courage. He confronted the most imminent dangers;
and accordingly his words were not disregarded: the man
who braved the scaffold had a right to exhort to submission.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
That man may boldly speak of obedience to God, who, to do
so, defies all the persecution of man. At Luther's voice all
objections vanished, the tumult subsided, seditious cries were
heard no longer, and the citizens of Wittemberg returned
quietly to their dwellings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIDYMUS&mdash;CARLSTADT&mdash;THE PROPHETS.</div>

<p>Gabriel Didymus, who had shown himself the most enthusiastic
of all the Augustine friars, did not lose one of the
reformer's words. "Do you not think Luther a wonderful
teacher?" asked a hearer in great emotion. "Ah!" replied
he, "I seem to listen to the voice, not of a man, but of an
angel."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Erelong Didymus openly acknowledged that he
had been deceived. "He is quite another man," said
Luther.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>It was not so at first with Carlstadt. Despising learning,
pretending to frequent the workshops of the Wittemberg
mechanics to receive understanding of the Holy Scriptures,
he was mortified at seeing his work crumble away at Luther's
appearance.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> In his eyes this was checking the reform itself.
Hence his air was always dejected, gloomy, and dissatisfied.
Yet he sacrificed his self-love for the sake of peace; he restrained
his desires of vengeance, and became reconciled,
outwardly at least, with his colleague, and shortly after resumed
his lectures in the university.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CONFERENCE BETWEEN LUTHER AND THE PROPHETS.</div>

<p>The chief prophets were not at Wittemberg when Luther
returned. Nicholas Storch was wandering through the
country; Mark Stubner had quitted Melancthon's hospitable
roof. Perhaps their prophetic spirit had disappeared, and
they had had <i>neither voice nor answer</i>,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> so soon as they
learnt that the new Elijah was directing his steps towards
this new Carmel. The old schoolmaster Cellarius alone had
remained. Stubner, however, being informed that the sheep
of his fold were scattered, hastily returned. Those who were
still faithful to "the heavenly prophecy" gathered round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
their master, reported Luther's speeches to him, and asked
him anxiously what they were to think and do.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Stubner
exhorted them to remain firm in their faith. "Let him appear,"
cried Cellarius, "let him grant us a conference,&mdash;let
him only permit us to set forth our doctrine, and then we
shall see......"</p>

<div class="sidenote">END OF THE CONTEST&mdash;IMPORTANCE AND RESULTS.</div>

<p>Luther cared little to meet such men as these; he knew
them to be of violent, impatient, and haughty disposition,
who could not endure even kind admonition, and who required
that every one should submit at the first word, as to
a supreme authority.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Such are enthusiasts in every age.
And yet, as they desired an interview, the doctor could not
refuse it. Besides, it might be of use to the weak ones of
the flock were he to unmask the imposture of the prophets.
The conference took place. Stubner opened the proceedings,
explaining in what manner he desired to regenerate the
Church and transform the world. Luther listened to him
with great calmness.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> "Nothing that you have advanced,"
replied he at last gravely, "is based upon Holy Scripture.&mdash;It
is all a mere fable." At these words Cellarius could contain
himself no longer; he raised his voice, gesticulated like
a madman, stamped, and struck the table with his fist,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> and
exclaimed, in a passion, that it was an insult to speak thus
to a man of God. Upon this Luther observed: "St. Paul
declares that the proofs of his apostleship were made known
by miracles; prove yours in like manner."&mdash;"We will do so,"
answered the prophets.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> "The God whom I worship," said
Luther, "will know how to bridle your gods." Stubner, who
had preserved his tranquillity, then fixed his eyes on the reformer,
and said to him with an air of inspiration, "Martin
Luther! I will declare what is now passing in thy soul......Thou
art beginning to believe that my doctrine is true."
Luther, after a brief pause, exclaimed: "God chastise thee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Satan!" At these words all the prophets were as if distracted.
"The Spirit, the Spirit!" cried they. Luther, adopting
that cool tone of contempt and cutting and homely language
so familiar to him, said, "I slap your <i>spirit</i> on the
snout."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Their clamours now increased; Cellarius, in particular,
distinguished himself by his violence. He foamed
and trembled with anger.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> They could not hear one another
in the room where they met in conference. At length the three
prophets abandoned the field and left Wittemberg the same
day.</p>

<p>Thus had Luther accomplished the work for which he had
left his retreat. He had made a stand against fanaticism,
and expelled from the bosom of the renovated Church the
enthusiasm and disorder by which it had been invaded. If
with one hand the Reformation threw down the dusty decretals
of Rome, with the other it rejected the assumptions
of the mystics, and established, on the ground it had won, the
living and unchangeable Word of God. The character of
the Reformation was thus firmly settled. It was destined
to walk for ever between these two extremes, equally remote
from the convulsions of the fanatics and the death-like torpor
of the papacy.</p>

<p>A whole population excited, deluded, and unrestrained,
had at once become tranquil, calm, and submissive; and the
most perfect quiet again reigned in that city which a few
days before had been like the troubled sea.</p>

<p>Perfect liberty was immediately established at Wittemberg.
Luther still continued to reside in the convent and
wear his monastic dress; but every one was free to do otherwise.
In communicating at the Lord's table, a general absolution
was sufficient, or a particular one might be obtained.
It was laid down as a principle to reject nothing but what
was opposed to a clear and formal declaration of Holy Scripture.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
This was not indifference; on the contrary, religion
was thus restored to what constitutes its very essence; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
sentiment of religion withdrew from the accessory forms in
which it had well nigh perished, and transferred itself to its
true basis. Thus the Reformation was saved, and its teaching
enabled to continue its development in the bosom of the
Church in charity and truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRANSLATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT.</div>

<p>Tranquillity was hardly established when the reformer
turned to his dear Melancthon, and demanded his assistance in
the final revision of the New Testament which he had brought
with him from the Wartburg.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> As early as the year 1519
Melancthon had laid down the grand principle, that the
Fathers must be explained according to Scripture, and not
Scripture according to the Fathers.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Meditating more
profoundly every day on the books of the New Testament, he
felt at once charmed by their simplicity and impressed by
their depth. "There alone can we find the true food of the
soul," boldly asserted this man so familiar with all the
philosophy of the ancients. Accordingly he readily complied
with Luther's invitation; and from that time the two
friends passed many long hours together studying and translating
the inspired Word. Often would they pause in
their laborious researches to give way to their admiration.
Luther said one day, "Reason thinks, Oh! if I could once
hear God speak! I would run from one end of the world to the
other to hear him......Listen then, my brother man! God,
the Creator of the heavens and the earth, speaks to thee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">EFFECTS OF THE TRANSLATION&mdash;EDITIONS.</div>

<p>The printing of the New Testament was carried on with
unexampled zeal.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> One would have said that the very
workmen felt the importance of the task in which they were
engaged. Three presses were employed in this labour, and
ten thousand sheets, says Luther, were printed daily.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>At length, on the 21st of September 1522, appeared the
complete edition of three thousand copies, in two folio
volumes, with this simple title: <span class="smcap">The New Testament</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">German</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Wittemberg</span>.
It bore no name of man. Every
German might henceforward procure the Word of God at a
moderate price.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>The new translation, written in the very tone of the holy
writings, in a language yet in its youthful vigour, and which
for the first time displayed its great beauties, interested,
charmed, and moved the lowest as well as the highest ranks.
It was a national work; the book of the people; nay more&mdash;it
was in very truth the Book of God. Even opponents could
not refuse their approbation to this wonderful work, and some
indiscreet friends of the reformer, impressed by the beauty of
the translation, imagined they could recognise in it a second inspiration.
This version served more than all Luther's writings
to the spread of Christian piety. The work of the sixteenth
century was thus placed on a foundation where nothing
could shake it. The Bible, given to the people, recalled the
mind of man, which had been wandering for ages in the
tortuous labyrinth of scholasticism, to the Divine fountain of
salvation. Accordingly the success of this work was prodigious.
In a short time every copy was sold. A second
edition appeared in the month of December; and in 1533
seventeen editions had been printed at Wittemberg, thirteen
at Augsburg, twelve at Basle, one at Erfurth, one at
Grimma, one at Leipsic, and thirteen at Strasburg.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Such
were the powerful levers that uplifted and transformed the
Church and the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SCRIPTURE AND FAITH.</div>

<p>While the first edition of the New Testament was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
through the press, Luther undertook a translation of the Old.
This labour, begun in 1522, was continued without interruption.
He published this translation in parts as they were
finished, the more speedily to gratify public impatience, and
to enable the poor to procure the book.</p>

<p>From Scripture and faith, two sources which in reality
are but one, the life of the Gospel has flowed, and is still
spreading over the world. These two principles combated
two fundamental errors. Faith was opposed to the Pelagian
tendency of Roman-catholicism; Scripture, to the theory of
tradition and the authority of Rome. Scripture led man to
faith, and faith led him back to Scripture. "Man can
do no meritorious work; the free grace of God, which
he receives by faith in Christ, alone saves him." Such was
the doctrine proclaimed in Christendom. But this doctrine
could not fail to impel Christendom to the study of Scripture.
In truth, if faith in Christ is everything in Christianity, if the
practices and ordinances of the Church are nothing, it is not to
the teaching of the Church that we should adhere, but to
the teaching of Christ. The bond that unites to Christ will
become everything to the believer. What matters to him the
outward link that connects him with an outward church enslaved
by the opinions of men?......Thus, as the doctrine of
the Bible had impelled Luther's contemporaries towards Jesus
Christ, so in turn the love they felt to Jesus Christ impelled
them to the Bible. It was not, as has been supposed in our
days, from a philosophical principle, or in consequence of doubt,
or from the necessity of inquiry, that they returned to Scripture;
it was because they there found the Word of Him
they loved. "You have preached Christ to us," said they to
the reformer, "let us now hear him himself." And they
seized the pages that were spread before them, as a letter
coming from heaven.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OPPOSITION&mdash;THE NEW TESTAMENT BURNT.</div>

<p>But if the Bible was thus gladly received by those who
loved Christ, it was scornfully rejected by those who preferred
the traditions and observances of men. A violent
persecution was waged against this work of the reformer's.
At the news of Luther's publication, Rome trembled. The
pen which had transcribed the sacred oracles was really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that which Frederick had seen in his dream, and which,
reaching to the Seven Hills, had shaken the tiara of the
papacy.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The monk in his cell, the prince on his throne,
uttered a cry of anger. Ignorant priests shuddered at the
thought that every citizen, nay every peasant, would now
be able to dispute with them on the precepts of our Lord.
The King of England denounced the work to the Elector
Frederick and to Duke George of Saxony. But as early
as the month of November the duke had ordered his subjects
to deposit every copy of Luther's New Testament in the
hands of the magistrates. Bavaria, Brandenburg, Austria,
and all the states devoted to Rome, published similar decrees.
In some places they made sacrilegious bonfires of these
sacred books in the public places.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Thus did Rome in the
sixteenth century renew the efforts by which paganism had
attempted to destroy the religion of Jesus Christ, at the
moment when the dominion was escaping from the priests
and their idols. But who can check the triumphant progress
of the Gospel? "Even after my prohibition," wrote
Duke George, "many thousand copies were sold and read
in my states."</p>

<p>God even made use of those hands to circulate his Word
that were endeavouring to destroy it. The Romanist theologians,
seeing that they could not prohibit the reformer's
work, published a translation of the New Testament. It
was Luther's version, altered here and there by the publishers.
There was no hindrance to its being read. Rome
as yet knew not that wherever the Word of God is established,
there her power is shaken. Joachim of Brandenburg
permitted all his subjects to read any translation of the
Bible, in Latin or in German, provided it did not come from
Wittemberg. The people of Germany, and those of Brandenburg
in particular, thus made great progress in the knowledge
of the truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IMPORTANCE OF THIS PUBLICATION.</div>

<p>The publication of the New Testament in the vulgar
tongue is an important epoch in the Reformation. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Feldkirchen's marriage was the first step in the progress of
the Reformation from doctrine into social life; if the abolition
of monastic vows was the second; if the re-establishment
of the Lord's Supper was the third,&mdash;the publication
of the New Testament was perhaps the most important of
all. It worked an entire change in society: not only in the
presbytery of the priest, in the monk's cell, and in the
sanctuary of our Lord; but also in the mansions of the great,
in the houses of the citizens, and cottages of the peasants.
When the Bible began to be read in the families of Christendom,
Christendom itself was changed. Then arose other
habits, other manners, other conversations, and another
life. With the publication of the New Testament, the Reformation
left the School and the Church to take possession
of the hearths of the people.</p>

<p>The effect produced was immense. The Christianity of
the primitive Church, drawn by the publication of the Holy
Scriptures from the oblivion of centuries in which it had
lain, was thus presented before the eyes of the nation; and
this view was sufficient to justify the attacks that had been
made against Rome. The simplest men, provided they
knew how to read, women, mechanics (our informant is a
contemporary and violent opponent of the Reformation)
eagerly studied the New Testament.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> They carried it about
with them; soon they knew it by heart, and the pages of
this book loudly proclaimed the perfect unison of Luther's
Reformation with the Divine revelation.</p>

<p>And yet it was only by fragments that the doctrine of the
Bible and of the Reformation had been set forth hitherto. A certain
truth had been put forward in one writing; a certain error
attacked in another. On one vast plain lay scattered and confused
the ruins of the old edifice and the materials of the new:
but the new edifice was wanting. The publication of the New
Testament undoubtedly satisfied this want. The Reformation
could say, as it gave this book: Here is my system!
But as every man is at liberty to assert that his system is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
that of the Bible, the Reformation was called to arrange
what it had found in Scripture. And this Melancthon now
did in its name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MELANCTHON'S COMMON-PLACES.</div>

<p>He had walked with regular but confident steps in the
development of his theology, and had from time to time
published the results of his inquiries. Before this, in 1520,
he had declared that in several of the seven sacraments he
could see nothing but an imitation of the Jewish ceremonies;
and in the infallibility of the pope, a haughty presumption
equally opposed to the Holy Scriptures and to good sense.
"To contend against these doctrines," he had said, "we require
more than one Hercules."<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Thus had Melancthon
reached the same point as Luther, although by a calmer and
more scientific process. The time had come in which he
was to confess his faith in his turn.</p>

<p>In 1521, during Luther's captivity, Melancthon's celebrated
work, "<i>On the Common-places of Theology</i>," had presented
to christian Europe a body of doctrine of solid foundation
and admirable proportion. A simple and majestic unity
appeared before the astonished eyes of the new generation.
The translation of the Testament justified the Reformation to
the people; Melancthon's <i>Common-places</i> justified it in the
opinion of the learned.</p>

<p>For fifteen centuries the Church had existed, and had
never seen such a work. Forsaking the ordinary developments
of scholastic theology, Luther's friend at last gave the
world a theological system derived solely from Scripture.
In it there reigned a breath of life, a vitality of understanding,
a strength of conviction, and a simplicity of statement,
forming a striking contrast with the subtle and pedantic
systems of the schools. The most philosophical minds, as
well as the strictest theologians, were equally filled with
admiration.</p>

<p>Erasmus entitled this work a wondrous army drawn up
in battle array against the tyrannous battalions of the false
doctors;<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and while he avowed his dissent from the author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
on several points, he added, that although he had always
loved him, he had never loved him so much as after reading
this work. "So true it is," said Calvin when presenting it
subsequently to France, "that the greatest simplicity is the
greatest virtue in treating of the christian doctrine."<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ORIGINAL SIN.</div>

<p>But no one felt such joy as Luther. Throughout life this
work was the object of his admiration. The disconnected
sounds that his hand, in the deep emotion of his soul, had
drawn from the harp of the prophets and apostles, were here
blended together in one enchanting harmony. Those scattered
stones, which he had laboriously hewn from the quarries
of Scripture, were now combined into a majestic edifice.
Hence he never ceased recommending the study of this work
to the youths who came to Wittemberg in search of knowledge:
"If you desire to become theologians," he would say,
"read Melancthon."<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>According to Melancthon, a deep conviction of the wretched
state to which man is reduced by sin is the foundation on
which the edifice of christian theology should be raised.
This universal evil is the primary fact, the leading idea
on which the science is based; it is the characteristic that
distinguishes theology from those sciences whose only instrument
is reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SALVATION&mdash;FREE WILL.</div>

<p>The christian divine, diving into the heart of man, explains
its laws and mysterious attractions, as another
philosopher in after-years explained the laws and attraction
of bodies. "Original sin," said he, "is an inclination born
with us,&mdash;a certain impulse which is agreeable to us,&mdash;a
certain force leading us to sin, and which has been communicated
by Adam to all his posterity. As in fire there is
a native energy impelling it to mount upward, as there is in
the loadstone a natural quality by which iron is attracted;
so also there is in man a primitive force that inclines him to
evil. I grant that in Socrates, Xenocrates, and Zeno were
found temperance, firmness, and chastity; these shadows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
virtues were found in impure hearts and originated in self-love.
This is why we should regard them not as real
virtues, but as vices."<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> This language may seem harsh; but
not so if we apprehend Melancthon's meaning aright. No one
was more willing than himself to acknowledge virtues in the
pagans that entitled them to the esteem of man; but he
laid down this great truth, that the sovereign law given by
God to all his creatures, is to love him above all things.
Now, if man, in doing that which God commands, does it not
from love to God, but from love of self, can God accept
him for daring to substitute himself in the place of His infinite
Majesty? and can there be no sinfulness in an action
that is express rebellion against the supreme Deity?</p>

<p>The Wittemberg divine then proceeds to show how man
is saved from this wretchedness. "The apostle!" said he,
"invites thee to contemplate the Son of God sitting at the
right hand of the Father, mediating and interceding for
us;<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and calls upon thee to feel assured that thy sins are
forgiven thee, that thou art reputed righteous, and accepted
by the Father for the sake of that Son who suffered for us
on the cross."</p>

<div class="sidenote">EFFECT OF THE COMMON-PLACES.</div>

<p>The first edition of the <i>Common-places</i> is especially remarkable
for the manner in which the theologian of Germany
speaks of free will. He saw more clearly perhaps
than Luther, for he was a better theologian than he, that this
doctrine could not be separated from that which constituted
the very essence of the Reformation. Man's justification before
God proceeds from faith alone: this is the first point.
This faith enters man's heart by the grace of God alone:
here is the second. Melancthon saw clearly that if he
allowed that man had any natural ability to believe, he would
be throwing down in the second point that great doctrine of
grace which he had stated in the first. He had too much
discernment and understanding of the Holy Scriptures to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
mistaken in so important a matter. But he went too far.
Instead of confining himself within the limits of the religious
question, he entered upon metaphysics. He established a
fatalism which might tend to represent God as the author
of evil,&mdash;a doctrine which has no foundation in Scripture.
"As all things which happen," said he, "happen necessarily,
according to the Divine predestination, there is no such thing
as liberty in our wills."<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>But the object Melancthon had particularly in view was
to present theology as a system of piety. The schoolmen
had so dried up the doctrine as to leave no traces of vitality
in it. The task of the Reformation was therefore to reanimate
this lifeless doctrine. In the subsequent editions,
Melancthon felt the necessity of expounding these doctrines
with greater clearness.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> But such was not precisely the
case in 1521. "To know Christ," said he, "is to know
his blessings.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Paul, in his epistle to the Romans, desiring
to give a summary of the christian doctrines, does not philosophize
on the mystery of the Trinity, on the mode of incarnation,
on active or passive creation; of what then does he
speak?&mdash;of the law,&mdash;of sin,&mdash;of grace. On this our knowledge
of Christ depends."</p>

<p>The publication of this body of theology was of inestimable
value to the cause of truth. Calumnies were refuted;
prejudices swept away. In the churches, palaces, and universities,
Melancthon's genius found admirers, who esteemed
the graces of his character. Even those who knew not the
author were attracted to his creed by his book. The roughness
and occasional violence of Luther's language had often
repelled many. But here was a man who explained those
mighty truths whose sudden explosion had shaken the world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
with great elegance of style, exquisite taste, admirable perspicuity,
and perfect order. The work was sought after and
read with avidity, and studied with ardour. Such gentleness
and moderation won all hearts. Such nobility and
force commanded their respect; and the superior classes of
society, hitherto undecided, were gained over by a wisdom
that made use of such beautiful language.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the adversaries of truth, whom Luther's
terrible blows had not yet humbled, remained for a time
silent and disconcerted at the appearance of Melancthon's
treatise. They saw that there was another man as worthy
of their hatred as Luther himself. "Alas!" exclaimed they,
"unhappy Germany! to what extremity wilt thou be brought
by this new birth!"<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>Between the years 1521 and 1595 the <i>Common-places</i>
passed through sixty-seven editions, without including translations.
Next to the Bible, this is the book that has possibly
contributed most to the establishment of the evangelical
doctrine.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Opposition&mdash;Henry VIII.&mdash;Wolsey&mdash;The Queen&mdash;Fisher&mdash;Thomas

<p>While the "grammarian" Melancthon was contributing by
these gentle strains a powerful support to Luther, men of
authority, enemies to the reformer, were turning violently
against him. He had escaped from the Wartburg and reappeared
on the stage of the world; and at this news the
rage of his former adversaries was revived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY THE EIGHTH&mdash;WOLSEY.</div>

<p>Luther had been three months and a half at Wittemberg
when a rumour, increased by the thousand tongues of fame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
brought intelligence that one of the greatest kings of Christendom
had risen against him. Henry VIII., head of the
house of Tudor, a prince descended from the families of
York and Lancaster, and in whose person, after so much
bloodshed, the red and white roses were at length united,
the mighty king of England, who claimed to re-establish on
the continent, and especially in France, the former influence
of his crown,&mdash;had just written a book against the poor
monk of Wittemberg. "There is much boasting about a
little book by the King of England," wrote Luther to Lange
on the 26th of June 1522.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Henry was then thirty-one years old; "he was tall, strong-built
and proportioned, and had an air of authority and
empire."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> His countenance expressed the vivacity of his
mind; vehement, presuming to make everything give way
to the violence of his passions, and thirsting for glory,
he at first concealed his faults under a certain impetuosity
that is peculiar to youth, and flatterers were not wanting
to encourage them. He would often visit, in company
with his courtiers, the house of his chaplain, Thomas Wolsey,
the son of an Ipswich butcher. Endowed with great
skill, of overweening ambition, and of unbounded audacity,
this man, protected by the Bishop of Winchester, chancellor
of the kingdom, had rapidly advanced in his master's favour,
and allured him to his residence by the attractions of pleasures
and disorders, in which the young prince would not
have ventured to indulge in his own palace. This is recorded
by Polydore Virgil, at that time papal sub-collector in
England.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> In these dissolute meetings, the chaplain surpassed
the licentiousness of the young courtiers who attended
Henry VIII. Forgetful of the decorum befitting a minister
of the Church, he would sing, dance, laugh, play the fool,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
fence, and indulge in obscene conversation.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> By these
means he succeeded in obtaining the first place in the king's
councils, and, as sole minister, all the princes of Christendom
were forced to purchase his favour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY'S COURT&mdash;QUEEN CATHERINE.</div>

<p>Henry lived in the midst of balls, banquets, and jousting,
and madly squandered the treasures his father had
slowly accumulated. Magnificent tournaments succeeded
each other without interval. In these sports the king, who
was distinguished above all the combatants by his manly
beauty, played the chief part.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> If the contest appeared for
a moment doubtful, the strength and address of the young
monarch, or the artful policy of his opponents, gave him
the victory, and the lists resounded with shouts and applause
in his honour. The vanity of the youthful prince was inflated
by these easy triumphs, and there was no success in
the world to which he thought he might not aspire. The
queen was often seen among the spectators. Her serious
features and sad look, her absent and dejected air, contrasted
strongly with the noise and glitter of these festivities.
Shortly after his accession to the throne, Henry VIII. had
espoused for reasons of state Catherine of Aragon, his senior
by eight years: she was his brother Arthur's widow, and aunt
to Charles V. While her husband followed his pleasures,
the virtuous Catherine, whose piety was truly Spanish, would
leave her bed in the middle of the night to take a silent part in
the prayers of the monks.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> She would kneel down without
cushion or carpet. At five in the morning, after taking a
little rest, she would again rise, and putting on the Franciscan
dress, for she had been admitted into the tertiary order of
St Francis, and hastily throwing the royal garments around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
her,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> would repair to church at six o'clock to join in the
service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FISHER AND MORE.</div>

<p>Two beings, living in such different spheres, could not long
continue together.</p>

<p>Romish piety had other representatives besides Catherine
in the court of Henry VIII. John Fisher, bishop of Rochester,
then nearly seventy years of age, as distinguished
for learning as for the austerity of his manners, was the
object of universal veneration. He had been the oldest
councillor of Henry VII., and the Duchess of Richmond,
grandmother to Henry VIII., calling him to her bedside, had
commended to his care the youth and inexperience of her
grandson. The king, in the midst of his irregularities, long
continued to revere the aged bishop as a father.</p>

<p>A man much younger than Fisher, a layman and lawyer,
had before this attracted general attention by his genius and
noble character. His name was Thomas More, son of one
of the judges of the King's Bench. He was poor, austere,
and diligent. At the age of twenty he had endeavoured to
quench the passions of youth by wearing a shirt of haircloth,
and by self-scourging. On one occasion, being summoned
by Henry VIII. while he was attending mass, he replied,
that God's service was before the king's. Wolsey introduced
him to Henry, who employed him on various embassies,
and showed him much kindness. He would often send for
him, and converse with him on astronomy, on Wolsey, and
on divinity.</p>

<p>In truth, the king himself was not unacquainted with the
Romish doctrines. It would appear, that if Arthur had
lived, Henry was destined for the archiepiscopal see of Canterbury.
Thomas Aquinas<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>, St. Bonaventure, tournaments,
banquets, Elizabeth Blunt and others of his mistresses&mdash;all
were mixed up in the mind and life of this prince, who had
masses of his own composition sung in his chapel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S BOOKS BURNT.</div>

<p>As soon as Henry had heard talk of Luther, he became indignant
against him, and hardly was the decree of the Diet of
Worms known in England, before he ordered the pontiff's bull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
against the reformer's works to be put in execution.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> On
the 12th of May 1521, Thomas Wolsey, who, together with
the office of chancellor of England, combined those of cardinal
and legate of Rome, went in solemn procession to St.
Paul's. This man, whose pride had attained the highest
pitch, thought himself the equal of kings. He used to sit in
a chair of gold, sleep in a golden bed, and a cover of cloth
of gold was spread on the table at his meals.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> On this
occasion he displayed great magnificence. His household,
consisting of 800 persons, among whom were barons, knights,
and sons of the most distinguished families, who hoped by
serving him to obtain public office, surrounded this haughty
prelate. Silk and gold glittered not only on his garments
(he was the first ecclesiastic who ventured to dress so sumptuously),<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
but even on the housings and harness of the
horses. Before walked a tall priest bearing a silver column
terminated by a cross; behind him, another ecclesiastic of
similar height carried the archiepiscopal crosier of York; a
nobleman at his side held the cardinal's hat.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Lords, prelates,
ambassadors from the pope and emperor, accompanied
him, followed by a long line of mules bearing chests covered
with the richest and most brilliant hangings. It was this
magnificent procession that was carrying to the burning pile
the writings of the poor monk of Wittemberg. When they
reached the cathedral, the insolent priest placed his cardinal's
hat on the altar. The virtuous Bishop of Rochester stationed
himself at the foot of the cross, and with agitated voice
preached earnestly against the heresy. After this the impious
books of the heresiarch were brought together and devoutly
burned in the presence of an immense crowd. Such
was the first intelligence that England received of the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY'S BOOK AGAINST LUTHER.</div>

<p>Henry would not stop here. This prince, whose hand was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
ever upraised against his adversaries, his wives, or his
favourites, wrote to the elector-palatine: "It is the devil,
who, by Luther's means, has kindled this immense conflagration.
If Luther will not be converted, let him and his
writings be burnt together!"<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>This was not enough. Having been convinced that the
progress of heresy was owing to the extreme ignorance of
the German princes, Henry thought the moment had arrived
for showing his learning. The victories of his battle-axe
did not permit him to doubt of those that were reserved for
his pen. But another passion, vanity, ever greatest in
the smallest minds, spurred the king onward. He was humiliated
at having no title to oppose to that of "Catholic,"
and "Most Christian," borne by the kings of Spain and
France, and he had long been begging a similar distinction
from the court of Rome. What would be more likely to
procure it than an attack upon heresy? Henry therefore
threw aside the kingly purple, and descended from his throne
into the arena of theological discussion. He enlisted Thomas
Aquinas, Peter Lombard, Alexander Hales, and Bonaventure
into his service; and the world beheld the publication of the
<i>Defence of the Seven Sacraments, against Martin Luther,
by the most invincible King of England and France, Lord of
Ireland, Henry the eighth of that name</i>.</p>

<p>"I will rush in front of the Church to save her," said
the King of England in this treatise; "I will receive in my
bosom the poisoned arrows of her assailants.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The present
state of things calls me to do so. Every servant of Christ,
whatever be his age, sex, or rank, should rise up against the
common enemy of Christendom.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY'S CONTEMPTUOUS AND ABUSIVE LANGUAGE.</div>

<p>"Let us put on a twofold breastplate; the heavenly
breastplate, to conquer by the weapons of truth him who
combats with those of error; but also an earthly breastplate,
that if he shows himself obstinate in his malice, the
hand of the executioner may constrain him to be silent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
that once at least he may be useful to the world, by the
terrible example of his death."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>Henry VIII. was unable to hide the contempt he felt
towards his feeble adversary. "This man," said the crowned
theologian, "seems to be in the pangs of childbirth; after a
travail without precedent, he produces nothing but wind.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
Remove the daring envelope of the insolent verbiage with
which he clothes his absurdities, as an ape is clothed in
purple, and what remains?......a wretched and empty
sophism."</p>

<p>The king defends, successively, the mass, penance, confirmation,
marriage, orders, and extreme unction; he is not
sparing of abusive language towards his opponent; he calls
him by turns a wolf of hell, a poisonous viper, a limb of the
devil. Even Luther's sincerity is attacked. Henry VIII.
crushes the mendicant monk with his royal anger, "and
writes as 'twere with his sceptre," says an historian.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>And yet it must be confessed that his work was not bad,
considering the author and his age. The style is not altogether
without force; but the public of the day did not confine
themselves to paying it due justice. The theological
treatise of the powerful King of England was received with
a torrent of adulation. "The most learned work the sun
ever saw," cried some.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>&mdash;"We can only compare it," re-echoed
others, "to the works of Augustine. He is a Constantine,
a Charlemagne!"&mdash;"He is more," said others, "he
is a second Solomon!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">EFFECT ON LUTHER.</div>

<p>These flatteries soon extended beyond the limits of England.
Henry desired John Clarke, dean of Windsor, his
ambassador at Rome, to present his book to the sovereign
pontiff. Leo X. received the envoy in full consistory.
Clarke laid the royal work before him, saying: "The king
my master assures you that, having now refuted Luther's
errors with the pen, he is ready to combat his adherents
with the sword." Leo, touched with this promise, replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
that the king's book could not have been written without
the aid of the Holy Ghost, and conferred upon Henry the
title of <i>Defender of the Faith</i>, which is still borne by the
sovereigns of England.</p>

<p>The reception which this volume met with at Rome contributed
greatly to increase the number of its readers. In
a few months many thousand copies issued from different
presses.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> "The whole christian world," says Cochl&oelig;us,
"was filled with admiration and joy."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Such extravagant panegyrics augmented the insufferable
vanity of this chief of the Tudors. He himself seemed to
have no doubt that he was inspired by the Holy Ghost.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
From that time he would suffer no contradiction. His
papacy was no longer at Rome, but at Greenwich; infallibility
reposed on his shoulders: at a subsequent period this
contributed greatly to the Reformation of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S VIOLENCE AND ENERGY.</div>

<p>Luther read Henry's book with a smile mingled with
disdain, impatience, and indignation. The falsehood and the
abuse it contained, but especially the air of contempt and
compassion which the king assumed, irritated the Wittemberg
doctor to the highest degree. The thought that the
pope had crowned this work, and that on all sides the
enemies of the Gospel were triumphing over the Reformation
and the reformer as already overthrown and vanquished,
increased his indignation. Besides, what reason
had he to temporize? Was he not fighting in the cause
of a King greater than all the kings of the earth? The
meekness of the Gospel appeared to him unseasonable.
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. He went beyond
all bounds. Persecuted, insulted, hunted down, wounded,
the furious lion turned round, and proudly roused himself
to crush his enemy. The elector, Spalatin, Melancthon,
and Bugenhagen, strove in vain to pacify him. They
would have prevented his replying; but nothing could stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
him. "I will not be gentle towards the King of England,"
said he. "I know that it is vain for me to humble myself,
to give way, to entreat, to try peaceful methods. At length
I will show myself more terrible towards these furious
beasts, who goad me every day with their horns. I will
turn mine upon them. I will provoke Satan until he falls
down lifeless and exhausted.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> If this heretic does not recant,
says Henry VIII. the new Thomas, he must be burnt
alive! Such are the weapons they are now employing
against me: the fury of stupid asses and swine of the brood
of Thomas Aquinas; and then the stake.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Well then, be
it so! Let these hogs advance if they dare, and let them
burn me! Here I am waiting for them. After my death,
though my ashes should be thrown into a thousand seas,
they will rise, pursue, and swallow up this abominable herd.
Living, I shall be the enemy of the papacy; burnt, I shall
be its destruction. Go then, swine of St. Thomas, do what
seemeth good to you. You will ever find Luther like a bear
upon your way, and as a lion in your path. He will spring
upon you whithersoever you go, and will never leave you at
peace, until he has broken your iron heads, and ground your
brazen foreheads into dust."</p>

<p>Luther first reproaches Henry VIII. with having supported
his doctrines solely by the decrees and opinions of
men. "As for me," says he, "I never cease crying the
Gospel, the Gospel! Christ, Christ!&mdash;And my adversaries
continue to reply: Custom, custom! Ordinances, ordinances!
Fathers, fathers!&mdash;St. Paul says: <i>Let not your faith stand
in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God</i> (1 Cor. ii. 5).
And the apostle by this thunderclap from heaven overthrows
and disperses, as the wind scatters the dust, all the hobgoblins
of this Henry. Frightened and confounded, these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Thomists, Papists, and Henrys fall prostrate before the
thunder of these words."<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WORD OF GOD AND NOT THE WORD OF MAN.</div>

<p>He then refutes the king's book in detail, and overturns
his arguments one after the other, with a perspicuity, spirit,
and knowledge of the Holy Scriptures and history of the
Church, but also with an assurance, disdain, and sometimes
violence, that ought not to surprise us.</p>

<p>Having reached the end of his confutation, Luther again
becomes indignant that his opponent should derive his arguments
from the Fathers only: this was the basis of the
whole controversy. "To all the words of the Fathers and of
men, of angels and of devils," said he, "I oppose, not old
customs, not the multitude of men, but the Word of Eternal
Majesty,&mdash;the Gospel, which even my adversaries are obliged
to recognise. To this I hold fast, on this I repose, in
this I boast, in this I exult and triumph over the papists,
the Thomists, the Henrys, the sophists, and all the swine of
hell.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The King of heaven is with me; for this reason I
fear nothing, although a thousand Augustines, a thousand
Cyprians, and a thousand of these churches which Henry
defends, should rise up against me. It is a small matter
that I should despise and revile a king of the earth, since he
himself does not fear in his writings to blaspheme the King of
heaven, and to profane His holy name by the most impudent
falsehoods."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>"Papists!" exclaimed he in conclusion, "will ye never
cease from your idle attacks? Do what you please. Nevertheless,
before that Gospel which I preach down must come
popes, bishops, priests, monks, princes, devils, death, sin,
and all that is not Christ or in Christ."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S ERROR&mdash;FISHER'S REPLY.</div>

<p>Thus spoke the poor monk. His violence certainly cannot
be excused, if we judge it by the rule to which he himself
appealed,&mdash;by the Word of God. It cannot even be justified
by alleging either the grossness of the age (for Melancthon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
knew how to observe decorum in his writings), or the
energy of his character, for if this energy had any influence
over his language, passion also exerted more. It is better,
then, that we should condemn it. And yet, that we may
be just, we should observe that in the sixteenth century this
violence did not appear so strange as it would now-a-days.
The learned were then an estate, as well as the princes. By
becoming a writer, Henry had attacked Luther. Luther
replied according to the established law in the republic of
letters, that we must consider the truth of what is said, and
not the quality of him that says it. Let us add also, that
when this same king turned against the pope, the abuse
which the Romish writers and the pope himself poured upon
him, far exceeded all that Luther had ever said.</p>

<p>Besides, if Luther called Dr. Eck an ass and Henry VIII.
a hog, he indignantly rejected the intervention of the secular
arm; while Eck was writing a dissertation to prove that
heretics ought to be burned, and Henry was erecting scaffolds
that he might conform with the precepts of the chancellor
of Ingolstadt.</p>

<p>Great was the emotion at the king's court; Surrey, Wolsey,
and the crowd of courtiers, put a stop to the festivities and
pageantry at Greenwich to vent their indignation in abuse
and sarcasm. The venerable Bishop of Rochester, who had
been delighted to see the young prince, formerly confided to
his care, breaking a lance in defence of the Church, was
deeply wounded by the attack of the monk. He replied to
it immediately. His words distinctly characterize the age
and the Church. "Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that
spoil the vines, says Christ in the Song of Songs. This
teaches us," said Fisher, "that we must take the heretics
before they grow big. Now Luther is become a big fox, so
old, so cunning, and so sly, that he is very difficult to catch.
What do I say?......a fox? He is a mad dog, a ravening
wolf, a cruel bear; or rather all those animals in one; for
the monster includes many beasts within him."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">REPLY OF THOMAS MORE.</div>

<p>Thomas More also descended into the arena to contend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
with the monk of Wittemberg. Although a layman, his
zeal against the Reformation amounted to fanaticism, if it
did not even urge him to shed blood. When young nobles
undertake the defence of the papacy, their violence often
exceeds even that of the ecclesiastics. "Reverend brother,
father, tippler, Luther, runagate of the order of St. Augustine,
misshapen bacchanal of either faculty, unlearned doctor of
theology."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Such is the language addressed to the reformer
by one of the most illustrious men of his age. He then proceeds
to explain the manner in which Luther had composed
his book against Henry VIII.: "He called his companions
together, and desired them to go each his own way and
pick up all sorts of abuse and scurrility. One frequented
the public carriages and boats; another the baths and
gambling-houses; a third the taverns and barbers' shops; a
fourth the mills and brothels. They noted down in their
tablets all the most insolent, filthy, and infamous things they
heard; and bringing back all these abominations and impurities,
they discharged them into that filthy kennel which
is called Luther's mind. If he retracts his falsehoods and
calumnies," continues More, "if he lays aside his folly and
his madness, if he swallows his own filth<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>......he will find
one who will seriously discuss with him. But if he proceeds
as he has begun, joking, teasing, fooling, calumniating,
vomiting sewers and cesspools<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>......let others do what
they please; as for me, I should prefer leaving the little
friar to his own fury and filth."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> More would have done
better to have restrained his own. Luther never degraded
his style to so low a degree. He made no reply.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY TO THE ELECTOR AND DUKES OF SAXONY.</div>

<p>This writing still further increased Henry's attachment to
More. He would often visit him in his humble dwelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
at Chelsea. After dinner, the king, leaning on his favourite's
shoulder, would walk in the garden, while Mistress More and
her children, concealed behind a window, could not turn
away their astonished eyes. After one of these walks, More,
who knew his man well, said to his wife: "If my head
could win him a single castle in France, he would not hesitate
to cut it off."</p>

<p>The king, thus defended by the Bishop of Rochester and
by his future chancellor, had no need to resume his pen.
Confounded at finding himself treated in the face of Europe
as a common writer, Henry VIII. abandoned the dangerous
position he had taken, and throwing away the pen of the
theologian, had recourse to the more effectual means of
diplomacy.</p>

<p>An ambassador was despatched from the court of Greenwich
with a letter for the elector and dukes of Saxony.
"Luther, the real serpent fallen from heaven," wrote he,
"is pouring out his floods of venom upon the earth. He is
stirring up revolts in the Church of Jesus Christ, abolishing
laws, insulting the powers that be, inflaming the laity
against the priests, and laymen and priests against the pope,
subjects against their sovereigns, and desires nothing better
than to see Christians fighting and destroying one another,
and the enemies of our faith hailing this scene of carnage
with a frightful grin.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>"What is this doctrine which he calls evangelical, if it be
not Wickliffe's? Now, most honoured uncles, I know what
your ancestors have done to destroy it. In Bohemia they
hunted it down like a wild beast, and driving it into a pit,
they shut it up and kept it fast. You will not allow it to
escape through your negligence, lest, creeping into Saxony,
and becoming master of the whole of Germany, its smoking
nostrils should pour forth the flames of hell, spreading that
conflagration far and wide which your nation hath so often
wished to extinguish in its blood.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">GENERAL MOVEMENT.</div>

<p>"For this reason, most worthy princes, I feel obliged to
exhort you and even to entreat you in the name of all that is
most sacred, promptly to extinguish the cursed sect of
Luther: put no one to death, if that can be avoided; but
if this heretical obstinacy continues, then shed blood without
hesitation, in order that the abominable heresy may disappear
from under heaven."<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>The elector and his brother referred the king to the approaching
council. Thus Henry VIII. was far from attaining his
end. "So great a name mixed up in the dispute," said Paul
Sarpi, "served to render it more curious, and to conciliate
general favour towards Luther, as usually happens in combats
and tournaments, where the spectators have always a
leaning to the weaker party, and take delight in exaggerating
the merit of his actions."<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">General Movement&mdash;The Monks&mdash;How the Reformation was carried on&mdash;Unlearned
Believer&mdash;The Old and the New Doctors&mdash;Printing and
Literature&mdash;Bookselling and Colportage.</p></blockquote>


<p>A great movement was going on. The Reformation, which,
after the Diet of Worms, had been thought to be confined
with its first teacher in the narrow chamber of a strong
castle, was breaking forth in every part of the empire, and,
so to speak, throughout Christendom. The two classes,
hitherto mixed up together, were now beginning to separate;
and the partisans of a monk, whose only defence was his
tongue, now took their stand fearlessly in the face of the
servants of Charles V. and Leo X. Luther had scarcely
left the walls of the Wartburg, the pope had excommunicated
all his adherents, the imperial diet had just condemned
his doctrine, the princes were endeavouring to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
crush it in most of the German states, the ministers of
Rome were lowering it in the eyes of the people by their
violent invectives, the other states of Christendom were
calling upon Germany to sacrifice a man whose assaults
they feared even at a distance; and yet this new sect, few in
numbers, and among whose members there was no organization,
no bond of union, nothing in short that concentrated
their common power, was already frightening the vast,
ancient, and powerful sovereignty of Rome by the energy
of its faith and the rapidity of its conquests. On all sides,
as in the first warm days of spring, the seed was bursting
from the earth spontaneously and without effort. Every day
showed some new progress. Individuals, villages, towns,
whole cities, joined in this new confession of the name of
Jesus Christ. There was unpitying opposition, there were
terrible persecutions, but the mysterious power that urged
forward all these people was irresistible; and the persecuted,
quickening their steps, going forward through exile, imprisonment,
and the burning pile, everywhere prevailed over
their persecutors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MONKS.</div>

<p>The monastic orders that Rome had spread over Christendom,
like a net intended to catch souls and keep them
prisoners, were the first to break their bonds, and rapidly to
propagate the new doctrine throughout the Church. The
Augustines of Saxony had walked with Luther, and felt that
inward experience of the Holy Word which, by putting them
in possession of God himself, dethroned Rome and her lofty
assumptions. But in the other convents of the order, evangelical
light had dawned in like manner. Sometimes they
were old men, who, like Staupitz, had preserved the sound
doctrines of truth in the midst of deluded Christendom, and
who now besought God to permit them to depart in peace,
for their eyes had seen his salvation. At other times, they
were young men, who had received Luther's teaching with
the eagerness peculiar to their age. The Augustine convents
at Nuremberg, Osnabruck, Dillingen, Ratisbon, Strasburg,
and Antwerp, with those in Hesse and Wurtemberg,
turned towards Jesus Christ, and by their courage excited
the wrath of Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EMANCIPATION OF THE MONKS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>But this movement was not confined to the Augustines
only. High-spirited men imitated them in the monasteries
of other orders, and notwithstanding the clamours of the
monks, who would not abandon their carnal observances, notwithstanding
the anger, contempt, sentences, discipline, and
imprisonments of the cloister, they fearlessly raised their
voices in behalf of that holy and precious truth, which they
had found at last after so many painful inquiries, such
despair and doubt, and such inward struggle. In the majority
of the cloisters, the most spiritual, pious, and learned
monks declared for the Reformation. In the Franciscan
convent at Ulm, Eberlin and Kettenbach attacked the slavish
works of monasticism, and the superstitious observances of the
Church, with an eloquence capable of moving the whole nation;
and they called for the immediate abolition of the monasteries
and houses of ill-fame. Another Franciscan, Stephen Kempe,
preached the Gospel at Hamburg, and, alone, presented a firm
front to the hatred, envy, menaces, snares, and attacks of the
priests, who were irritated at seeing the crowd abandon their
altars, and flock with enthusiasm to hear his sermons.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>Frequently the superiors of the convents were the first
led away in the path of reform. At Halberstadt, Neuenwerk,
Halle, and Sagan, the priors set the example to their
monks, or at least declared that if a monk felt his conscience
burdened by the weight of monastic vows, far from detaining
him in the convent, they would take him by the shoulders
and thrust him out of doors.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW THE REFORMATION SPREAD AMONG THE PEOPLE.</div>

<p>Indeed throughout all Germany the monks were seen laying
down their frocks and cowls at the gates of the monasteries.
Some were expelled by the violence of the brethren
or the abbots; others, of mild and pacific character, could no
longer endure the continual disputes, abuse, clamour, and
hatred which pursued them even in their slumbers; the majority
were convinced that the monastic life was opposed to
the will of God and to a christian life; some had arrived at
this conviction by degrees; others suddenly, by reading a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
passage in the Bible. The sloth, grossness, ignorance, and
degradation that constituted the very nature of the mendicant
orders, inspired with indescribable disgust all men of
elevated mind, who could no longer support the society of
their vulgar associates. One day, a Franciscan going his
rounds, stopped with the box in his hand begging alms at a
blacksmith's forge in Nuremberg: "Why," said the smith,
"do you not gain your bread by the work of your own
hands?" At these words the sturdy monk threw away his
staff, and seizing the hammer plied it vigorously on the
anvil. The useless mendicant had become an honest workman.
His box and frock were sent back to the monastery.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>The monks were not the only persons who rallied round
the standard of the Gospel; priests in still greater number
began to preach the new doctrines. But preachers were not
required for its propagation; it frequently acted on men's
minds, and aroused them from their deep slumber without
any one having spoken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VARIOUS WAYS OF PROPAGATION.</div>

<p>Luther's writings were read in cities, towns, and even villages;
at night by the fireside the schoolmaster would often
read them aloud to an attentive audience. Some of the hearers
were affected by their perusal; they would take up the Bible
to clear away their doubts, and were struck with surprise at
the astonishing contrast between the Christianity of the Bible
and their own. After oscillating between Rome and Scripture,
they soon took refuge with that living Word which
shed so new and sweet a radiance on their hearts. While
they were in this state, some evangelical preacher, probably
a priest or a monk, would arrive. He spoke eloquently and
with conviction;<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> he announced that Christ had made full
atonement for the sins of his people; he demonstrated by
Holy Scripture the vanity of works and human penances.
A terrible opposition would then break out; the clergy, and
sometimes the magistrates, would strain every nerve to bring
back the souls they were about to lose. But there was in
the new preaching a harmony with Scripture and a hidden
force that won all hearts, and subdued even the most rebellious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
At the peril of their goods, and of their life if need be,
they ranged themselves on the side of the Gospel, and forsook
the lifeless and fanatical orators of the papacy.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Sometimes
the people, incensed at being so long misled, compelled
them to retire; more frequently the priests, deserted by their
flocks, without tithes or offerings, departed voluntarily and in
sadness to seek a livelihood elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> And while the
supporters of the ancient hierarchy returned from these
places sorrowful and dejected, and sometimes bidding farewell
to their old flocks in the language of anathema, the
people, transported with joy by peace and liberty, surrounded
the new preachers with their applause, and, thirsting for the
Word of God, carried them in triumph into the church and
into the pulpit.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>A word of power, proceeding from God, was at that time
regenerating society. The people, or their leaders, would
frequently invite some man celebrated for his faith to come
and enlighten them; and instantly, for love of the Gospel, he
abandoned his interests and his family, his country and
friends.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The persecution often compelled the partisans of
the Reformation to leave their homes: they reached some
spot where it was as yet unknown; here they would enter
a house that offered an asylum to poor travellers; there
they would speak of the Gospel, read a chapter to the
attentive hearers, and perhaps, at the request of their new
friends, obtained permission to preach once publicly in the
church......Upon this a vast uproar would break out in the
city, and the greatest exertions were ineffectual to quench
it.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> If they could not preach in the church, they found some
other spot. Every place became a temple. At Husum in
Holstein, Hermann Tast, who was returning from Wittemberg,
and against whom the clergy of the parish had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
closed the church doors, preached to an immense crowd in the
cemetery, beneath the shade of two large trees, not far from
the spot where, seven centuries before, Anschar had proclaimed
the Gospel to the heathen. At Arnstadt, Gaspard Güttel,
an Augustine monk, preached in the market-place. At
Dantzic, the Gospel was announced on a little hill without
the city. At Gosslar, a Wittemberg student taught the new
doctrines in a meadow planted with lime-trees; whence the
evangelical Christians were denominated the <i>Lime-tree
Brethren</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNLEARNED BELIEVERS.</div>

<p>While the priests were exhibiting a sordid covetousness
before the eyes of the people, the new preachers said to them,
"Freely we have received, freely do we give."<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> The idea
often published by the new preachers from the pulpit, that
Rome had formerly sent the Germans a corrupted Gospel,
and that now for the first time Germany heard the Word of
Christ in its heavenly and primal beauty, produced a deep
impression on men's minds.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> And the noble thought of the
equality of all men, of a universal brotherhood in Jesus
Christ, laid strong hold upon those souls which for so long a
period had groaned beneath the yoke of feudalism and of the
papacy of the Middle Ages.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>Often would unlearned Christians, with the New Testament
in their hands, undertake to justify the doctrine of the
Reformation. The catholics who remained faithful to Rome
withdrew in affright; for to priests and monks alone had been
assigned the task of studying sacred literature. The latter
were therefore compelled to come forward; the conference
began; but erelong, overwhelmed by the declarations of Holy
Scripture cited by these laymen, the priests and monks knew
not how to reply.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>......"Unhappily Luther had persuaded
his followers," says Cochl&oelig;us, "to put no faith in any other
oracle than the Holy Scriptures." A shout was raised in
the assembly, and proclaimed the scandalous ignorance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
these old theologians, who had hitherto been reputed such
great scholars by their own party.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">OLD AND NEW DOCTORS.</div>

<p>Men of the lowest station, and even the weaker sex, with
the aid of God's Word, persuaded and led away men's hearts.
Extraordinary works are the result of extraordinary times.
At Ingolstadt, under the eyes of Dr. Eck, a young weaver
read Luther's works to the assembled crowd. In this very
city, the university having resolved to compel a disciple of
Melancthon to retract, a woman, named Argula de Staufen,
undertook his defence, and challenged the doctors to a public
disputation. Women and children, artisans and soldiers,
knew more of the Bible than the doctors of the schools or
the priests of the altars.</p>

<p>Christendom was divided into two hostile bodies, and their
aspects were strikingly contrasted. Opposed to the old champions
of the hierarchy, who had neglected the study of languages
and the cultivation of literature (as one of their own
body informs us), were generous-minded youths, devoted to
study, investigating Scripture, and familiarizing themselves
with the masterpieces of antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Possessing an active
mind, an elevated soul, and intrepid heart, these young men
soon acquired such knowledge, that for a long period none
could compete with them. It was not only the vitality of their
faith which rendered them superior to their contemporaries,
but an elegance of style, a perfume of antiquity, a sound
philosophy, a knowledge of the world, completely foreign to
the theologians "of the old leaven," as Cochl&oelig;us himself
terms them.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Accordingly, when these youthful defenders
of the Reformation met the Romish doctors in any assembly,
they attacked them with such ease and confidence, that these
ignorant men hesitated, became embarrassed, and fell into
a contempt merited in the eyes of all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LITERATURE AND THE PRINTING-PRESS.</div>

<p>The ancient edifice was crumbling under the load of
superstition and ignorance; the new one was rising on the
foundations of faith and knowledge. New elements entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
deep into the lives of the people. Torpor and dulness were
in all parts succeeded by a spirit of inquiry and a thirst for
instruction. An active, enlightened, and living faith took
the place of superstitious devotion and ascetic meditations.
Works of piety succeeded bigoted observances and penances.
The pulpit prevailed over the ceremonies of the altar; and
the ancient and sovereign authority of God's Word was at
length restored in the Church.</p>

<p>The printing-press, that powerful machine discovered in
the fifteenth century, came to the support of all these exertions,
and its terrible missiles were continually battering the
walls of the enemy.</p>

<p>The impulse which the Reformation gave to popular
literature in Germany was immense. Whilst in the year
1513 only thirty-five publications had appeared, and thirty-seven
in 1517, the number of books increased with astonishing
rapidity after the appearance of Luther's theses. In
1518 we find seventy-one different works; in 1519, one hundred
and eleven; in 1520, two hundred and eight; in 1521,
two hundred and eleven; in 1522, three hundred and forty-seven;
and in 1523, four hundred and ninety-eight......And
where were all these published? For the most part at Wittemberg.
And who were their authors? Generally Luther
and his friends. In 1522 one hundred and thirty of the reformer's
writings were published; and in the year following,
one hundred and eighty-three. In this same year only twenty
Roman-catholic publications appeared.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The literature of
Germany thus saw the light in the midst of struggles, and
contemporaneously with her religion. Already it appeared
learned, profound, full of daring and life, as later times have
seen it. The national spirit showed itself for the first time
without mixture, and at the very moment of its birth received
the baptism of fire from christian enthusiasm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COLPORTAGE.</div>

<p>What Luther and his friends composed, others circulated.
Monks, convinced of the unlawfulness of monastic obligations,
desirous of exchanging a long life of slothfulness for
one of active exertion, but too ignorant to proclaim the Word
of God, travelled through the provinces, visiting hamlets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
cottages, where they sold the books of Luther and his
friends. Germany soon swarmed<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> with these bold colporteurs.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
Printers and booksellers eagerly welcomed every
writing in defence of the Reformation; but they rejected the
books of the opposite party, as generally full of ignorance
and barbarism.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> If any one of them ventured to sell a book
in favour of the papacy, and offered it for sale in the fairs at
Frankfort or elsewhere, merchants, purchasers, and men of
letters overwhelmed him with ridicule and sarcasm.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> It was
in vain that the emperor and princes had published severe
edicts against the writings of the reformers. As soon as an
inquisitorial visit was to be paid, the dealers who had received
secret intimation concealed the books that it was intended
to proscribe; and the multitude, ever eager for what
is prohibited, immediately bought them up, and read them
with the greater avidity. It was not only in Germany that
such scenes were passing; Luther's writings were translated
into French, Spanish, English, and Italian, and circulated
among these nations.</p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Luther at Zwickau&mdash;The Castle of Freyberg&mdash;Worms&mdash;Frankfort&mdash;Universal
Movement&mdash;Wittemberg the Centre of the Reformation&mdash;Luther's
Sentiments.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">LUTHER AT ZWICKAU.</div>

<p>If the most puny instruments inflicted such terrible blows
on Rome, what was it when the voice of the monk of Wittemberg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
was heard? Shortly after the discomfiture of the
new prophets, Luther, in a layman's attire, traversed the
territories of Duke George in a waggon. His gown was
hidden, and the reformer seemed to be a plain citizen of the
country. If he had been recognised, if he had fallen into the
hands of the exasperated duke, perhaps his fate would have
been sealed. He was going to preach at Zwickau, the
birthplace of the pretended prophets. It was no sooner
known at Schneeberg, Annaberg, and the surrounding places,
than the people crowded around him. Fourteen thousand
persons flocked into the city, and as there was no church
that could contain such numbers, Luther went into the
balcony of the town-hall, and preached before an audience of
twenty-five thousand persons who thronged the market-place,
some of whom had mounted on heaps of cut stones
piled up near the building.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> The servant of God was dilating
with fervour on the election of grace, when suddenly cries were
heard from the midst of the auditory. An old woman of
haggard mien stretched out her emaciated arms from the stone
on which she had taken her station, and seemed desirous
of restraining with her fleshless hands that crowd which was
about to fall prostrate at the feet of Jesus. Her wild yells
interrupted the preacher. "It was the devil," said Seckendorff,
"who had taken the form of an old woman in order to
excite a disturbance."<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> But it was all in vain; the reformer's
words silenced the wicked spirit; these thousands of hearers
caught his enthusiasm; glances of admiration were exchanged;
hands were warmly grasped, and erelong the
tongue-tied monks, unable to avert the storm, found it
necessary to leave Zwickau.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CASTLE OF FREYBERG.</div>

<p>In the castle of Freyberg dwelt Henry, brother of Duke
George. His wife, a princess of Mecklenburg, had the preceding
year borne him a son who had been named Maurice.
With a fondness for the table and for pleasure, Duke Henry
combined the rudeness and coarse manners of a soldier.
In other respects, he was pious after the fashion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
times, had gone to the Holy Land, and made a pilgrimage
to St. Iago of Compostella. He would often say: "At
Compostella I placed a hundred golden florins on the altar
of the saint, and said to him: O St. Iago, to please thee I
came hither; I make thee a present of this money; but if
these knaves (the priests) take it from thee, I cannot help it;
so be on your guard."<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>A Franciscan and a Dominican, both disciples of Luther,
had been for some time preaching the Gospel at Freyberg.
The duchess, whose piety had inspired her with a horror of
heresy, listened to their sermons with astonishment that this
gentle word of a Saviour was the object she had been
taught to fear. Gradually her eyes were opened, and she
found peace in Christ Jesus. No sooner had Duke George
learnt that the Gospel was preached at Freyberg, than he
entreated his brother to oppose these novelties. Chancellor
Strehlin and the canons seconded his prayer with their
fanaticism. A violent explosion took place in the court of
Freyberg. Duke Henry harshly reprimanded and reproached
his wife, and more than once the pious duchess watered her
child's cradle with her tears. Yet by degrees her prayers
and gentleness won the heart of her husband; the rough
man was softened; harmony was restored between the
married pair, and they were enabled to join in prayer beside
their sleeping babe. Great destinies were hovering over that
child; and from that cradle, where a christian mother had so
often poured forth her sorrows, God was one day to bring
forth the liberator of the Reformation.</p>

<p>Luther's intrepidity had excited the inhabitants of Worms.
The imperial decree terrified the magistrates; all the churches
were closed; but in a public place, filled by an immense
crowd, a preacher ascended a rudely constructed pulpit, and
proclaimed the Gospel with persuasive accents. If the
authorities showed a disposition to interfere, the hearers dispersed
in a moment, and stealthily carried away the pulpit;
but the storm was no sooner passed, than it was immediately
set up in some more secluded spot, to which the crowd
again flocked to hear the Word of Christ. This temporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
pulpit was every day carried from one place to another, and
served to encourage the people, still agitated by the emotions
of the great drama lately performed in their city.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">WORMS&mdash;FRANKFORT.</div>

<p>At Frankfort on the Maine, one of the principal free cities
of the empire, all was in commotion. A courageous evangelist,
Ibach, preached salvation by Jesus Christ. The clergy,
among whom was Cochl&oelig;us, so notorious by his writings
and his opposition, irritated against this audacious colleague,
denounced him to the Archbishop of Mentz. The council
undertook his defence, although with timidity, but to no
purpose, for the clergy discharged the evangelical minister,
and compelled him to leave the town. Rome triumphed;
everything seemed lost; the poor believers fancied themselves
for ever deprived of the Word; but at the very moment
when the citizens appeared inclined to yield to these tyrannical
priests, many nobles declared for the Gospel. Max of
Molnheim, Harmuth of Cronberg, George of Stockheim, and
Emeric of Reiffenstein, whose estates lay near Frankfort,
wrote to the council: "We are constrained to rise up against
these spiritual wolves." And addressing the clergy, they
said: "Embrace the evangelical doctrine, recall Ibach, or
else we will refuse to pay our tithes!"</p>

<p>The people, who listened gladly to the Reformation,
being encouraged by the language of the nobles, began to
put themselves in motion; and one day, just as Peter Mayer,
the persecutor of Ibach and the most determined enemy of
the reform, was going to preach against the heretics, a great
uproar was heard. Mayer was alarmed, and hastily quitted
the church. This movement decided the council. All the
preachers were enjoined by proclamation to preach the pure
Word of God, or to leave the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WITTEMBERG&mdash;CENTRE OF REFORM.</div>

<p>The light which proceeded from Wittemberg, as from the
heart of the nation, was thus shedding its rays through the
whole empire. In the west,&mdash;Berg, Cleves, Lippstadt, Munster,
Wesel, Miltenberg, Mentz, Deux Ponts, and Strasburg,
listened to the Gospel; on the south,&mdash;Hof, Schlesstadt,
Bamberg, Esslingen, Halle in Swabia, Heilbrunn, Augsburg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Ulm, and many other places, received it with joy. In the
east,&mdash;the duchy of Liegnitz, Prussia, and Pomerania opened
their gates to it; and in the north,&mdash;Brunswick, Halberstadt,
Gosslar, Zell, Friesland, Bremen, Hamburg, Holstein, and
even Denmark, with other neighbouring countries, were
moved at the sounds of this new doctrine.</p>

<p>The Elector Frederick had declared that he would allow
the bishops to preach freely in his states, but that he would
deliver no one into their hands. Accordingly, the evangelical
teachers, persecuted in other countries, soon took refuge in
Saxony. Ibach of Frankfort, Eberlin of Ulm, Kauxdorf of
Magdeburg, Valentine Must&oelig;us, whom the canons of Halberstadt
had horribly mutilated,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and other faithful ministers,
coming from all parts of Germany, fled to Wittemberg, as
the only asylum in which they could be secure. Here they
conversed with the reformers; at their feet they strengthened
themselves in the faith; and communicated to them their
own experience and the knowledge they had acquired. It is
thus the waters of the rivers return by the clouds from the
vast expanse of the ocean, to feed the glaciers whence they
first descended to the plains.</p>

<p>The work which was evolving at Wittemberg, and formed
in this manner of many different elements, became more and
more the work of the nation, of Europe, and of Christendom.
This school, founded by Frederick, and quickened by Luther,
was the centre of an immense revolution which regenerated
the Church, and impressed on it a real and living unity far
superior to the apparent unity of Rome. The Bible reigned
at Wittemberg, and its oracles were heard on all sides. This
academy, the most recent of all, had acquired that rank and
influence in Christendom which had hitherto belonged to the
ancient university of Paris. The crowds that flocked thither
from every part of Europe made known the wants of the
Church and of the nations; and as they quitted these walls,
now become holy to them, they carried back with them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the Church and the people the Word of Grace appointed to
heal and to save the nations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S SENTIMENTS.</div>

<p>Luther, as he witnessed this success, felt his confidence
increase. He beheld this feeble undertaking, begun in the
midst of so many fears and struggles, changing the aspect of
the christian world, and was himself astonished at the result.
He had foreseen nothing of the kind, when first he rose up
against Tetzel. Prostrate before the God whom he adored,
he confessed the work to be His, and exulted in the assurance
of a victory that could not be torn from him. "Our
enemies threaten us with death," said he to Harmuth of
Cronberg; "if they had as much wisdom as foolishness,
they would, on the contrary, threaten us with life. What an
absurdity and insult to presume to threaten death to Christ
and Christians, who are themselves lords and conquerors of
death!<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>......It is as if I would seek to frighten a man by
saddling his horse and helping him to mount. Do they not
know that Christ is risen from the dead? In their eyes He
is still lying in the sepulchre; nay more&mdash;in hell. But we
know that He lives." He was grieved at the thought that
he was regarded as the author of a work, in the smallest
details of which he beheld the hand of God. "Many believe
because of me," said he. "But those alone truly believe,
who would continue faithful even should they hear (which
God forbid!) that I had denied Jesus Christ. True disciples
believe not in Luther, but in Jesus Christ. As for myself,
I do not care about Luther.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Whether he is a saint or
a knave, what matters it? It is not he that I preach; but
Christ. If the devil can take him, let him do so! But let
Christ abide with us, and we shall abide also."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MAINSPRING.</div>

<p>And vainly, indeed, would men endeavour to explain this
great movement by mere human circumstances. Men of
letters, it is true, sharpened their wits and discharged their
keen-pointed arrows against the pope and the monks; the
shout of liberty, which Germany had so often raised against
the tyranny of the Italians, again resounded in the castles
and provinces; the people were delighted with the song of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
"the nightingale of Wittemberg," a herald of the spring that
was everywhere bursting forth.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> But it was not a mere
outward movement, similar to that effected by a longing for
earthly liberty, that was then accomplishing. Those who
assert that the Reformation was brought about by bribing
princes with the wealth of the convents,&mdash;the priests with
permission to marry,&mdash;and the people with the prospect of
freedom, are strangely mistaken in its nature. No doubt a
useful employment of the funds that had hitherto supported
the sloth of the monks; no doubt marriage and liberty, gifts
that proceed direct from God, might have favoured the
development of the Reformation; but the mainspring was
not there. An interior revolution was then going on in the
depths of the human heart. Christians were again learning
to love, to pardon, to pray, to suffer, and even to die for a
truth that offered no repose save in heaven. The Church
was passing through a state of transformation. Christianity
was bursting the bonds in which it had so long been confined,
and returning in life and vigour into a world that had
forgotten its ancient power. The hand that made the
world was turned towards it again; and the Gospel, reappearing
in the midst of the nations, accelerated its course,
notwithstanding the violent and repeated efforts of priests
and kings; like the ocean which, when the hand of God
presses on its surface, rises calm and majestic along its
shores, so that no human power is able to resist its progress.</p>

<h2>BOOK X.</h2>

<h3>AGITATION, REVERSES, AND PROGRESS. 1522-1526.</h3>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Political Element&mdash;Want of Enthusiasm at Rome&mdash;Siege of Pampeluna&mdash;Courage
of Ignatius&mdash;Transition&mdash;Luther and Loyola&mdash;Visions&mdash;Two
Principles.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Reformation, which at first had existed in the hearts of
a few pious men, had entered into the worship and the life
of the Church; it was natural that it would take a new step,
and penetrate into civil relationships and the life of nations.
Its progress was always from the interior to the exterior.
We are about to see this great revolution taking possession
of the political life of the world.</p>

<p>For eight centuries past, Europe had formed one vast
sacerdotal state. Emperors and kings had been under the
patronage of popes. Whenever any energetic resistance had
been offered to her audacious pretensions, particularly in
Germany and France, Rome eventually had the upperhand,
and princes, docile agents of her terrible decrees, had been
seen fighting to secure her dominion against private believers
obedient to their rule, and profusely shedding in her
behalf the blood of their people's children.</p>

<p>No injury could be inflicted on this vast ecclesiastical
state, of which the pope was the head, without affecting the
political relations.</p>

<p>Two great ideas then agitated Germany. On the one
hand, a desire for a revival of faith; and on the other, a
longing for a national government, in which the German
states might be represented, and thus serve as a counterpoise
to the power of the emperors.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">POLITICAL ELEMENT.</div>

<p>The Elector Frederick had insisted on this latter point at
the election of Maximilian's successor; and the youthful
Charles had complied. A national government had been
framed in consequence, consisting of the imperial governor
and representatives of the electors and circles.</p>

<p>Thus Luther reformed the Church, and Frederick of Saxony
reformed the State.</p>

<p>But while, simultaneously with the religious reform, important
political modifications were introduced by the leaders
of the nation, it was to be feared that the commonalty would
also put itself in motion, and by its excesses, both in politics
and religion, compromise both reforms.</p>

<p>This violent and fanatical intrusion of the people and of
certain ringleaders, which seems inevitable where society is
shaken and in a state of transition, did not fail to take
place in Germany at the period of which we are now treating.</p>

<p>There were other circumstances also that contributed to
give rise to such disorders.</p>

<p>The emperor and the pope had combined against the Reformation,
and it seemed on the point of falling beneath the
blows of two such powerful enemies. Policy, ambition, and
interest compelled Charles V. and Leo X. to attempt its
destruction. But these are poor champions to contend
against the truth. Devotedness to a cause which is looked
upon as sacred can only be conquered by a similar devotedness.
But the Romans, yielding to the impulses of a Leo X.,
were enthusiastic about a sonnet or a melody, and insensible
to the religion of Jesus Christ; and if any less futile thought
came across their minds, instead of purifying and tempering
their hearts anew in the Christianity of the apostles, they were
busied with alliances, wars, conquests, and treaties, which
gained new provinces, and with cold disdain left the Reformation
to awaken on all sides a religious enthusiasm, and march
triumphantly to more noble conquests. The enemy that had
been doomed to destruction in the cathedral of Worms, reappeared
full of confidence and strength; the contest must be
severe; and blood must flow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANXIETIES OF THE EMPEROR.</div>

<p>Yet some of the most imminent dangers that threatened
the Reformation seemed at this time to be disappearing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Shortly before the publication of the edict of Worms, the
youthful Charles, standing one day at a window of his palace
with his confessor, had said, it is true, as he laid his hand on
his heart: "I swear to hang up at this very window the first
man who shall declare himself a Lutheran after the publication
of my edict."<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> But it was not long before his zeal abated
considerably. His project for reviving the ancient glory of
the holy empire, that is to say, of increasing his own power,
had been coldly received.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> Dissatisfied with Germany, he
left the banks of the Rhine, repaired to the Netherlands,
and availed himself of his residence there to afford the
monks those gratifications that he found himself unable to
give them in the empire. Luther's works were burnt at
Ghent by the hangman with all possible solemnity. More
than fifty thousand spectators were present at this auto-da-fé;
the emperor himself looking on with an approving
smile.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> He thence proceeded to Spain, where wars and
internal dissensions compelled him, for a time at least, to
leave Germany at peace. Since he is refused in the empire
the power to which he lays claim, let others hunt down the
heretic of Wittemberg. More anxious thoughts engrossed
all his attention.</p>

<p>In effect, Francis I., impatient to try his strength with
his rival, had thrown down the gauntlet. Under the pretence
of restoring the children of Jean d'Albret, king of
Navarre, to their patrimony, he had begun a bloody struggle,
destined to last all his life, by invading that kingdom
with an army under the command of Lesparre, whose
rapid conquests were only checked by the fortress of Pampeluna.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIEGE OF PAMPELUNA&mdash;INIGO.</div>

<p>On these strong walls an enthusiasm was kindled, destined
afterwards to oppose the enthusiasm of the reformer, and to
breathe into the papacy a new spirit of energy, devotedness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and authority. Pampeluna was destined to be the cradle, as
it were, of the rival of the Wittemberg monk.</p>

<p>The chivalrous spirit that had so long animated the
christian world survived in Spain alone. The wars against
the Moors, scarcely terminated in the Peninsula, and continually
breaking out in Africa, with distant and adventurous
expeditions beyond the seas, fostered in the Castilian youths
that enthusiastic and unaffected valour of which Amadis
formed the ideal model.</p>

<p>Among the defenders of Pampeluna was a young gentleman,
Inigo Lopez of Recalda, the youngest of a family of
thirteen children. Recalda, better known as Ignatius Loyola,
had been brought up in the court of Ferdinand the Catholic.
His person was graceful;<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> he was expert in handling the
sword and the lance, and ardently desired the glory of
chivalry. To array himself in glittering arms, to ride a
noble steed,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> to expose himself to the brilliant dangers of the
tournament, to engage in hazardous exploits, to share in the
envenomed struggles of faction,<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> and to display as much devotion
for Saint Peter as for his lady-love&mdash;such was the life
of this young chevalier.</p>

<p>The governor of Navarre having gone into Spain to procure
succours, had left the defence of Pampeluna to Inigo and
a few nobles. The latter, perceiving the superiority of the
French troops, resolved to withdraw. Inigo conjured them
to make a stand against Lesparre; finding them resolute in
their intention, he looked at them with indignation, accusing
them of cowardice and perfidy; he then flung himself
alone into the citadel, determined to hold it at the peril of
his life.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS WOUNDS&mdash;HIS STUDIES.</div>

<p>The French, who were enthusiastically received into
Pampeluna, having proposed a capitulation to the commander
of the fortress: "Let us suffer everything," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Inigo impetuously to his companions, "rather than surrender."<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
Upon this the French began to batter the walls
with their powerful machines, and soon attempted an assault.
Inigo's courage and exhortations inspirited the Spaniards;
they repelled the assailants with arrows, swords, and battle-axes;
Inigo fought at their head: standing on the ramparts,
his eyes glistening with rage, the young cavalier brandished
his sword, and the enemy fell beneath his blows. Suddenly
a ball struck the wall which he was defending; a splinter
from the stone wounded him severely in the right leg, and
the ball recoiling with the violence of the blow, broke his
left leg. Inigo fell senseless.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> The garrison surrendered
immediately; and the French, admiring the courage of their
youthful opponent, conveyed him in a litter to his parents
in the castle of Loyola. In this lordly mansion, from which
he afterwards derived his name, Inigo had been born, eight
years after Luther, of one of the most illustrious families of
that district.</p>

<p>A painful operation had become necessary. Under the
most acute sufferings, Inigo firmly clenched his hands, but
did not utter a single groan.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TRANSFORMATION&mdash;ARMED VIGILS.</div>

<p>Confined to a wearisome inactivity, he found it necessary
to employ his active imagination. In the absence of the
romances of chivalry, which had hitherto been his only
mental food, he took up the life of Jesus Christ, and the
legends or <i>Flowers of the Saints</i>. This kind of reading,
in his state of solitude and sickness, produced an extraordinary
impression on his mind. The noisy life of tournaments
and battles, which had hitherto exclusively occupied
his thoughts, appeared to recede, to fade and vanish from his
sight; and at the same time a more glorious career seemed
opening before his astonished eyes. The humble actions of
the saints and their heroic sufferings appeared far more
worthy of praise than all the high feats of arms and chivalry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Stretched upon his bed, a prey to fever, he yielded to the
most opposite thoughts. The world that he was forsaking,
the world whose holy mortifications lay before him, appeared
together, the one with its pleasures, the other with
its austerities; and these two worlds contended in deadly
struggle within his bosom. "What if I were to act like St.
Francis or St. Dominick?" said he.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Then the image of
the lady to whom he had pledged his heart rose before him:
"She is not a countess," exclaimed he with artless vanity,
"nor a duchess; but her condition is much loftier than
either."<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Such thoughts as these filled him with distress
and <i>ennui</i>, while his plan of imitating the saints inspired
him with peace and joy.</p>

<p>From this period his choice was made. As soon as his
health was restored, he determined to bid adieu to the world.
After having, like Luther, shared in one more repast with his
old companions in arms, he departed alone, in great secrecy,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
for the solitary dwellings that the hermits of St. Benedict had
hewn out of the rocks of Montserrat. Impelled not by a sense
of sin or his need of Divine grace, but by a desire to become
a "knight of the Virgin," and of obtaining renown by mortifications
and pious works, after the example of the whole
army of saints, he confessed for three days together, gave
his rich attire to a beggar, put on sackcloth, and girt himself
with a rope.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Then, remembering the celebrated armed
vigils of Amadis of Gaul, he suspended his sword before an
image of Mary, passed the night in watching in his new and
strange costume, and sometimes on his knees, sometimes upright,
but always in prayer and with the pilgrim's staff in his
hand, he repeated all the devout practices that the illustrious
Amadis had observed before him. "It was thus," says his
biographer, the Jesuit Maffei, "that while Satan was arming
Luther against all laws human and divine, and while that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
infamous heresiarch appeared at Worms, and impiously declared
war against the apostolic see, Christ, by a call from
his heavenly providence, was awakening this new champion,
and binding him, and those who were to follow in his steps,
to the service of the Roman pontiff, and opposing him to the
licentiousness and fury of heretical depravity."<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">COMPUNCTIONS OF CONSCIENCE.</div>

<p>Loyola, although still lame in one of his legs, dragged
himself by winding and lonely paths to Manresa, where he
entered a Dominican convent, in order to devote himself in
this secluded spot to the severest mortifications. Like
Luther, he daily begged his bread from door to door.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> He
passed seven hours upon his knees, and scourged himself
three times a-day; at midnight he rose to pray; he allowed
his hair and nails to grow, and in the thin pale face of the
monk of Manresa it would have been impossible to recognise
the young and brilliant knight of Pampeluna.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANGUISH&mdash;LUTHER AND LOYOLA.</div>

<p>Yet the hour had come when religious ideas, which
hitherto had been to Inigo a mere chivalrous amusement,
were to be evolved in him with greater depth, and make
him sensible of a power to which he was as yet a stranger.
Suddenly, without anything to give him warning, the joy he
had felt disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> In vain he had recourse to prayer
and singing hymns; he could find no rest.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> His imagination
had ceased to call up pleasing illusions; he was left
alone with his conscience. A state so new to him was beyond
his comprehension, and he fearfully asked himself
whether God, after all the sacrifices he had made, was still
angry with him. Night and day gloomy terrors agitated his
soul; he shed bitter tears; with loud cries he called for the
peace of mind which he had lost......but all was in vain.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
He then recommenced the long confession he had made at
Montserrat. "Perhaps," thought he, "I have forgotten
something." But this confession only increased his anguish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
for it reminded him of all his errors. He wandered about
gloomy and dejected; his conscience accused him of having
done nothing all his life but add sin to sin; and the
wretched man, a prey to overwhelming terrors, filled the
cloister with his groans.</p>

<p>Strange thoughts then entered into his heart. Finding
no consolation in confession or in the various ordinances of
the Church,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> he began, like Luther, to doubt their efficacy.
But instead of forsaking the works of men, and seeking the
all-sufficient work of Christ, he asked himself whether he
should not again pursue the pleasures of time. His soul
sprang eagerly towards the delights of the world he had renounced,<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
but immediately recoiled with affright.</p>

<p>Was there, at that time, any difference between the monk
of Manresa and the monk of Erfurth? Unquestionably,&mdash;in
secondary points: but the state of their souls was the
same. Both were deeply sensible of the multitude of their
sins. Both were seeking for reconciliation with God, and
longed to have the assurance in their hearts. If a Staupitz
with the Bible in his hand had appeared in the convent of
Manresa, possibly Inigo might have become the Luther of the
Peninsula. These two great men of the sixteenth century,
these founders of two spiritual powers which for three centuries
have been warring together, were at this moment brothers;
and perhaps, if they had met, Luther and Loyola would have
embraced, and mingled their tears and their prayers.</p>

<p>But from this hour the two monks were destined to follow
entirely different paths.</p>

<p>Inigo, instead of feeling that his remorse was sent to drive
him to the foot of the cross, persuaded himself that these
inward reproaches proceeded not from God, but from the
devil; and he resolved never more to think of his sins, to
erase them from his memory, and bury them in eternal
oblivion.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Luther turned towards Christ; Loyola only fell
back upon himself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">DECISIVE MOMENT&mdash;VISIONS.</div>

<p>Visions came erelong to confirm Inigo in the conviction at
which he had arrived. His own resolves had become a substitute
for the grace of the Lord; his own imaginings supplied
the place of God's Word. He had looked upon the
voice of God in his conscience as the voice of the devil; and
accordingly the remainder of his history represents him as
given up to the inspirations of the spirit of darkness.</p>

<p>One day Loyola met an old woman, as Luther in the hour
of his trial was visited by an old man. But the Spanish
woman, instead of proclaiming remission of sins to the penitent
of Manresa, predicted visitations from Jesus. Such was
the Christianity to which Loyola, like the prophets of Zwickau,
had recourse. Inigo did not seek truth in the Holy Scriptures;
but imagined in their place immediate communication
with the world of spirits. He soon lived entirely in ecstasies
and contemplation.</p>

<p>One day, as he was going to the church of St. Paul, outside
the city, he walked along the banks of the Llobregat,
and sat down absorbed in meditation. His eyes were fixed
on the river, which rolled its deep waters silently before him.
He was lost in thought. Suddenly he fell into an ecstasy:
he saw with his bodily eyes what men can with difficulty
understand after much reading, long vigils, and study.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> He
rose, and as he stood on the brink of the river, he appeared
to have become another man; he then knelt down at the
foot of a cross which was close at hand, prepared to sacrifice
his life in the service of that cause whose mysteries had just
been revealed to him.</p>

<p>From this time his visions became more frequent. Sitting
one day on the steps of St. Dominick's church at Manresa,
he was singing a hymn to the Holy Virgin, when on a sudden
his soul was wrapt in ecstasy; he remained motionless,
absorbed in contemplation; the mystery of the most Holy
Trinity was revealed to his sight under magnificent symbols;<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
he shed tears, filled the church with his sobs, and all day
long continued speaking of this ineffable vision.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE TWO PRINCIPLES.</div>

<p>These numerous apparitions had removed all his doubts;
he believed, not like Luther because the things of faith were
written in the Word of God, but because of the visions he
had seen. "Even had there been no Bible," say his apologists,
"even had these mysteries never been revealed in
Scripture,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> he would have believed them, for God had appeared
to him."<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Luther, on taking his doctor's degree, had
pledged his oath to Holy Scripture,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and the only infallible
authority of the Word of God had become the fundamental
principle of the Reformation. Loyola, at this time, bound
himself to dreams and visions; and chimerical apparitions
became the principle of his life and of his faith.</p>

<p>Luther's sojourn in the convent of Erfurth and that of
Loyola in the convent of Manresa explain to us&mdash;the first,
the Reformation; the latter, modern Popery. The monk
who was to reanimate the exhausted vigour of Rome repaired
to Jerusalem after quitting the cloister. We will not follow
him on this pilgrimage, as we shall meet with him again in
the course of this history.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Victory of the Pope&mdash;Death of Leo X.&mdash;The Oratory of Divine Love&mdash;Adrian
VI.&mdash;Plan of Reform&mdash;Opposition.</p></blockquote>


<p>While these events were taking place in Spain, Rome herself
appeared to be assuming a more serious character. The
great patron of music, hunting, and festivities disappeared
from the pontifical throne, and was succeeded by a pious and
grave monk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF LEO X.</div>

<p>Leo X. had been greatly delighted at hearing of the
edict of Worms and Luther's captivity; and immediately,
in testimony of his victory, he had consigned the effigy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
writings of the reformer to the flames.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> It was the second
or third time that Rome had indulged in this innocent pleasure.
At the same time Leo X., wishing to testify his
gratitude to Charles V., united his army with the emperor's.
The French were compelled to evacuate Parma, Piacenza,
and Milan; and Giulio de Medici, the pope's cousin, entered
the latter city. The pope was thus approaching the summit
of human power.</p>

<p>These events took place at the beginning of winter 1521.
Leo X. was accustomed to spend the autumn in the country.
At such times he would leave Rome without surplice, and,
what was considered still more scandalous, wearing boots.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
At Viterbo he amused himself with hawking; at Corneti in
hunting the stag: the lake of Bolsena afforded him the
pleasure of fishing; thence he passed to his favourite villa at
Malliana, where he spent his time in the midst of festivities.
Musicians, improvisatori, and all the artists whose talents
could enliven this delightful abode, were gathered round the
pontiff. He was residing there when he received intelligence
of the capture of Milan. A great agitation immediately
ensued in the villa. The courtiers and officers could not restrain
their exultation, the Swiss discharged their carbines,
and Leo, in excess of joy, walked up and down his room all
night, from time to time looking out of the window at the
rejoicings of the soldiers and of the people. He returned to
Rome, fatigued but intoxicated with success. He had
scarcely arrived at the Vatican when he felt suddenly indisposed.
"Pray for me," said he to his attendants. He had
not even time to receive the holy sacrament, and died in the
prime of life, at the age of forty-five, in the hour of victory,
and amid the noise of rejoicing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORATORY OF DIVINE LOVE&mdash;ADRIAN VI.</div>

<p>The crowd followed the pontiff to the grave, loading him
with abuse. They could not forgive him for having died
without the sacrament and for leaving his debts unpaid, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
result of his enormous expenses. "You gained your pontificate
like a fox," said the Romans; "you held it like a lion,
and left it like a dog."</p>

<p>Such was the funeral oration with which Rome honoured
the pope who excommunicated the Reformation, and whose
name serves to designate one of the great epochs in history.</p>

<p>Meantime a feeble reaction against the spirit of Leo and
of Rome was already beginning in Rome itself. Some
pious men had there established an oratory for their common
edification,<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> near the spot which tradition assigns as the
place where the early Christians used to meet. Contarini,
who had heard Luther at Worms, was the leader in these
prayer-meetings. Thus a species of reformation was beginning
at Rome almost at the same time as at Wittemberg.
It has been said with truth, that wherever the seeds of piety
exist, there also are the germs of reformation. But these
good intentions were soon to be frustrated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADRIAN'S CHARACTER.</div>

<p>In other times, a Gregory VII. or an Innocent III. would
have been chosen to succeed Leo X., could such men have
been found; but the interest of the Empire was now superior
to that of the Church, and Charles V. required a pope devoted
to his service. The Cardinal de Medici, afterwards
Clement VII., seeing that he had no chance at present of
obtaining the tiara, exclaimed: "Elect the Cardinal of
Tortosa, a man in years, and whom every one regards as a
saint." This prelate, who was a native of Utrecht, and
sprung from the middle classes, was chosen, and reigned
under the title of Adrian VI. He had been professor at
Louvain, and afterwards tutor to Charles V., by whose influence
he was invested with the Roman purple in 1517.
Cardinal de Vio supported his nomination. "Adrian," said
he, "had a great share in Luther's condemnation by the
Louvain doctors."<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> The cardinals, tired out and taken by
surprise, elected this foreigner; but as soon as they came to
their senses (says a chronicler), they almost died of fright.
The thought that the austere Netherlander would not accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the tiara gave them some little consolation at first; but
this hope was not of long duration. Pasquin represented
the pontiff-elect under the character of a schoolmaster, and
the cardinals as little boys under the rod. The citizens were
so exasperated that the members of the conclave thought
themselves fortunate to have escaped being thrown into the
river.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> In Holland, on the contrary, the people testified by
general rejoicings their delight at giving a pope to the
Church. "Utrecht planted; Louvain watered; the Emperor
gave the increase," was the inscription on the hangings
suspended from the fronts of the houses. A wag wrote
below these words: "And God had nothing to do with it."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the dissatisfaction at first manifested by
the people of Rome, Adrian VI. repaired to that city in the
month of August 1522, and was well received. It was reported
that he had more than five thousand benefices in his
gift, and every man reckoned on having his share. For
many years the papal throne had not been filled by such a
pontiff. Just, active, learned, pious, sincere, and of irreproachable
morals, he permitted himself to be blinded neither
by favour nor passion.</p>

<p>He followed the middle course traced out by Erasmus,
and in a book reprinted at Rome during his pontificate, he
said: "It is certain that the pope may err in matters of
faith, in defending heresy by his opinions or decretals."<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> This
is indeed a remarkable assertion for a pope to make; and
if the ultra-montanists reply that Adrian was mistaken
on this point, by this very circumstance they affirm what
they deny, viz. the fallibility of the popes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADRIAN'S REFORMS OPPOSED.</div>

<p>Adrian arrived at the Vatican with his old housekeeper,
whom he charged to continue providing frugally for his moderate
wants in that magnificent palace which Leo X. had
filled with luxury and dissipation. He had not a single taste
in common with his predecessor. When he was shown the
magnificent group of Laocoon, discovered a few years before,
and purchased at an enormous price by Julius II., he turned
coldly away, observing: "They are the idols of the heathen!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
"I would rather serve God," said he, "in my deanery of
Louvain, than be pope at Rome." Alarmed at the dangers
with which the Reformation threatened the religion of the
Middle Ages, and not, like the Italians, at those to which
Rome and her hierarchy were exposed, it was his earnest desire
to combat and check it; and he judged the best means
to this end would be a reform of the Church carried out by
the Church itself. "The Church needs a reform," said he;
"but we must go step by step."&mdash;"The pope means," says
Luther, "that a few centuries should intervene between each
step." In truth, for ages the Church had been moving towards
a reformation. But there was no longer room for temporizing:
it was necessary to act.</p>

<p>Faithful to his plan, Adrian set about banishing from the
city all perjurers, profane persons, and usurers; a task by
no means easy, since they formed a considerable portion of
the inhabitants.</p>

<p>At first the Romans ridiculed him; soon they began to
hate him. The sacerdotal rule, the immense profits it
brought, the power of Rome, the sports, festivals, and luxury
that filled it,&mdash;all would be irretrievably lost, if there was a
return to apostolic manners.</p>

<p>The restoration of discipline, in particular, met with a strong
opposition. "To succeed in this," said the cardinal high-penitentiary,
"we must first revive the zeal of Christians.
The remedy is more than the patient can bear, and will cause
his death. Beware lest, by wishing to preserve Germany,
you should lose Italy."<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> In effect, Adrian had soon greater
cause to fear Romanism than Lutheranism itself.</p>

<p>Exertions were made to bring him back into the path he
was desirous of quitting. The old and crafty Cardinal
Soderini of Volterra, the familiar friend of Alexander VI.,
Julius II., and Leo X.,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> often let fall hints well adapted to
prepare the worthy Adrian for that character, so strange to
him, which he was called upon to fill. "The heretics,"
remarked Soderini one day, "have in all ages spoken of the
corrupt manners of the court of Rome, and yet the popes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
have never changed them."&mdash;"It has never been by reforms,"
said he on another occasion, "that heresies have
been put down, but by crusades."&mdash;"Alas," replied the
pontiff with a deep sigh, "how unhappy is the fate of a
pope, since he has not even liberty to do what is right!"<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Diet of Nuremberg&mdash;Soliman's Invasion&mdash;The Nuncio calls for Luther's
Death&mdash;The Nuremberg Preachers&mdash;Promise of Reform&mdash;Grievances
of the Nation&mdash;Decree of the Diet&mdash;Fulminating Letter of the Pope&mdash;Luther's
Advice.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">DIET OF NUREMBERG.</div>

<p>On the 23d March 1522, before Adrian had reached Rome,
the diet assembled at Nuremberg. Prior to this date the
Bishops of Mersburg and Misnia had asked permission of the
Elector of Saxony to make a visitation of the convents and
churches in his states. Frederick, thinking that truth would
be strong enough to resist error, had given a favourable
reply to this request, and the visitation took place. The
bishops and their doctors preached violently against the
Reformation, exhorting, threatening, and entreating; but
their arguments seemed useless; and when, desirous of
having recourse to more effectual weapons, they called upon
the secular authority to carry out their decrees, the elector's
ministers replied, that the business was one that required to
be examined according to the Bible, and that the elector in
his advanced age could not begin to study divinity. These
efforts of the bishops did not lead one soul back to the fold of
Rome; and Luther, who passed through these districts shortly
after, and preached in his usual powerful strain, erased the
feeble impressions that had been here and there produced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOLIMAN INVADES HUNGARY&mdash;A NEW STORM.</div>

<p>It might be feared that the emperor's brother, the Archduke
Ferdinand, would do what Frederick had refused. This
young prince, who presided during part of the sittings of the
diet, gradually acquiring more firmness, might in his zeal
rashly draw the sword which his more prudent and politic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
brother wisely left in the scabbard. In fact, he had already
begun a cruel persecution of the partisans of the Reformation
in his hereditary states of Austria. But God on several
occasions made use of the same instrument for the deliverance
of reviving Christianity that he had employed in the
destruction of corrupt Christianity. The crescent appeared
in the terrified provinces of Hungary. On the 9th of August,
after a six weeks' siege, Belgrade, the bulwark of this
kingdom and of the empire, fell before Soliman's attack.
The followers of Mahomet, after having evacuated Spain,
seemed bent on entering Europe by the east. The Diet of
Nuremberg forgot the monk of Worms, to think only of the
Sultan of Constantinople. But Charles V. kept both these
adversaries in mind. On the 31st of October, he wrote to the
pope from Valladolid: "We must check the Turks, and punish
the abettors of Luther's poisonous doctrines with the sword."<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>The storm which seemed to be passing away from the
Reformation, and turning towards the east, soon gathered
anew over the head of the reformer. His return to Wittemberg,
and the zeal he had there displayed, rekindled animosity.
"Now that we know where to catch him," said Duke
George, "let us execute the decree of Worms!" It was
even asserted in Germany that Charles V. and Adrian would
meet at Nuremberg to concert their plans.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> "Satan feels the
wound that has been inflicted on him," says Luther; "and
this is why he is so furious. But Christ has already stretched
out his hand, and will soon trample him under foot in spite
of the gates of hell."<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CALL FOR LUTHER'S PUNISHMENT.</div>

<p>In the month of December 1522, the diet again assembled
at Nuremberg. Everything seemed to indicate, that if Soliman
had been the great enemy that had engaged its attention
in the spring session, Luther would be that of the
winter meeting. Adrian VI., in consequence of his German
descent, flattered himself with the hope of a more favourable
reception from his nation than any pope of Italian origin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
could expect.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> He therefore commissioned Chieregati, whom
he had known in Spain, to repair to Nuremberg.</p>

<p>As soon as the diet had opened, several princes spoke
strongly against Luther. The Cardinal-archbishop of Salzburg,
who enjoyed the full confidence of the emperor, desired
that prompt and decisive measures should be taken before
the arrival of the Elector of Saxony. The Elector Joachim
of Brandenburg, always decided in his proceedings, and the
Chancellor of Treves, alike pressed for the execution of the
edict of Worms. The other princes were in a great measure
undecided and divided in opinion. The state of confusion in
which the Church was placed filled its most faithful servants
with anguish. The Bishop of Strasburg exclaimed, in a full
meeting of the diet, "I would give one of my fingers not to
be a priest."<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>Chieregati, jointly with the Cardinal of Salzburg, called
for Luther's death. "We must," said he in the pope's name,
and holding the pontiff's brief in his hands, "we must cut
off this gangrened member from the body.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Your fathers
put John Huss and Jerome of Prague to death at Constance;
but they live again in Luther. Follow the glorious example
of your ancestors, and, with the aid of God and St. Peter,
gain a signal victory over the infernal dragon."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NUREMBERG PREACHERS.</div>

<p>On hearing the brief of the pious and moderate Adrian,
most of the princes were awe-stricken.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Many were beginning
to understand Luther better, and had hoped better
things of the pope. Thus then Rome, under an Adrian, will
not acknowledge her faults; she still hurls her thunderbolts,
and the provinces of Germany are about to be laid waste
and drowned in blood. While the princes remained sad and
silent, the prelates and members of the diet in the interest of
Rome became tumultuous. "Let him be put to death,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
cried they, according to the report of the Saxon envoy, who
was present at the sitting.</p>

<p>Very different language was heard in the churches of Nuremberg.
The people crowded into the chapel attached to
the hospital, and to the churches of the Augustines, of St.
Sebaldus, and St. Lawrence, to listen to the preaching of
the Gospel. Andrew Osiander was preaching powerfully in
the latter temple. Several princes, and especially Albert,
margrave of Brandenburg, who, in his quality of grand-master
of the Teutonic Order, took rank immediately after
the archbishops, went there frequently. Monks, leaving the
convents in the city, were learning trades in order to gain a
livelihood by their labour.</p>

<p>Chieregati could not endure so much boldness. He insisted
that the priests and rebellious monks should be thrown
into prison. The diet, notwithstanding the resolute opposition
of the envoys of the Elector of Saxony and of the Margrave
Casimir, determined on seizing the monks, but consented
to make a previous communication of the nuncio's
complaint to Osiander and his colleagues. A committee, of
which the fanatical Cardinal of Salzburg was president, was
intrusted with this duty. The danger was threatening; the
struggle was about to begin, and it was the council of the
nation that provoked it.</p>

<p>The people, however, anticipated them. While the diet
was deliberating what should be done with these ministers,
the town-council of Nuremberg were considering how they
should proceed with regard to the decision of the diet. They
resolved, without exceeding their jurisdiction, that if attempts
were made to lay violent hands on the city preachers, they
should be set at liberty by main force. Such a determination
was very significant. The astonished diet replied to
the nuncio, that it was not lawful to arrest the preachers
of the free city of Nuremberg, unless previously convicted
of heresy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROMISES OF REFORM.</div>

<p>Chieregati was deeply moved at this new insult to the
omnipotence of the papacy. "Well, then," said he haughtily
to Ferdinand, "do nothing, but let me act. I will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
these preachers seized in the pope's name."<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> As soon as
the Cardinal-archbishop Albert of Mentz and the Margrave
Casimir were informed of this extravagant design, they hastened
to the legate, entreating him to renounce his intentions.
The nuncio was immovable, affirming that in the bosom of
Christendom obedience to the pope was of the first importance.
The two princes quitted the legate, saying: "If you
persist in your design, we desire that you will give us warning;
for we will leave the city before you venture to lay
hands on these preachers."<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> The legate abandoned his
project.</p>

<p>Despairing of success by measures of authority, he resolved
to have recourse to other expedients, and with this view he
acquainted the diet with the intentions and mandates of the
pontiff, which he had hitherto kept secret.</p>

<p>But the worthy Adrian, a stranger to the ways of the
world, injured by his very frankness the cause he so heartily
desired to serve. "We are well aware," said he in the resolutions
intrusted to his legate, "that for many years certain
abuses and abominations have crept into the holy city.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
The contagion has spread from the head to the members; it
has descended from the popes to the other ecclesiastics. It
is our desire to reform this Roman court, whence proceed so
many evils; the whole world is craving after it, and to effect
this we submitted to ascend the papal chair."</p>

<p>The partisans of Rome blushed for shame as they heard
this extraordinary language. They thought, with Pallavicini,
that these avowals were too sincere.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> The friends of
the Reformation, on the contrary, were delighted at seeing
Rome proclaim her own corruption. They no longer doubted
that Luther was right, since the pope himself declared it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">ALARM OF THE LEGATE.</div>

<p>The reply of the diet showed how much the authority of
the sovereign pontiff had fallen in the empire. Luther's
spirit seemed to have entered into the hearts of the representatives
of the nation. The moment was favourable: Adrian's
ear seemed open; the emperor was absent; the diet resolved
to collect into one body all the grievances that for ages Germany
had endured from Rome, and forward them to the
pope.</p>

<p>The legate was frightened at this determination. He entreated
and threatened in turns. He insinuated that under
a purely religious exterior the reformer concealed great
political dangers; he asserted, like Adrian, that these children
of iniquity had no other end in view than to destroy all
obedience, and lead every man to do as he pleased. "Will
those men keep your laws," said he, "who not only despise
the holy canons of the Father, but still further, tear them
in pieces and burn them in their diabolical fury? Will
they spare your lives who do not fear to insult, to strike,
to kill the anointed of the Lord? It is your persons, your
goods, your houses, your wives, your children, your domains,
your states, your temples, and all that you adore, that are
threatened by this frightful calamity."<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">GRIEVANCES OF THE NATION.</div>

<p>All these declamations proved of no avail. The diet,
although commending the promises of the pope, required for
their speedy fulfilment that a free and christian council
should be assembled as soon as possible at Strasburg, Mentz,
Cologne, or Metz, in which laymen should be present. Laymen
in a council! Laymen regulating the affairs of the
Church in concert with priests! It is more than we can see
even now in many protestant states. The diet added, that
every man should have liberty to speak freely for the glory
of God, the salvation of souls, and the good of the christian
commonwealth.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> It then proceeded to draw up a catalogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of its grievances, which amounted to the number of
eighty. The abuses and arts of the popes and the Roman
court to extort money from Germany; the scandals and
profanations of the clergy; the disorders and simony of
the ecclesiastical tribunals; the encroachments on the secular
power for the enslaving of consciences; were all set
forth with as much frankness as energy. The states gave
the pope to understand that the traditions of men were
the source of all this corruption, and concluded by saying:
"If these grievances are not redressed within a limited
time, we shall seek other means to escape from so many
oppressions and sufferings."<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Chieregati, foreseeing the
terrible recess that the diet would draw up, hastily left
Nuremberg, that he might not have to deliver this sad and
insolent message.</p>

<p>Yet was there not reason to fear that the diet would seek
to make amends for its boldness by sacrificing Luther?
People thought so at first; but a spirit of justice and truth
had descended on this assembly. It demanded, as Luther
had done, the convocation of a free council in the empire,
and added, that in the meanwhile the pure Gospel alone
should be preached, and nothing should be printed without
the approbation of a certain number of pious and learned
men.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> These resolutions furnish us with the means of calculating
the immense progress the Reformation had made
subsequently to the Diet of Worms; and yet the knight
of Feilitsch, the Saxon envoy, solemnly protested against
this censorship, moderate as it was, which the diet prescribed.
This decree was regarded as the first triumph of
the Reformation, which would be followed by other more
decisive victories. The Swiss themselves, in the midst of
their mountains, thrilled with delight. "The Roman pontiff
is vanquished in Germany," said Zwingle. "We have
nothing more to do than deprive him of his weapons. This
is the battle we have now to fight, and a furious one it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
be. But Christ is the umpire of the conflict."<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Luther said
publicly that God himself had inspired the princes to draw
up this edict.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POPE'S LETTER TO FREDERICK.</div>

<p>The indignation at the Vatican among the papal ministers
was very great. What! is it not enough to have a pope
who disappoints all the expectations of the Romans, and in
whose palace there is neither singing nor playing; but, more
than this, secular princes are allowed to hold a language
that Rome detests, and refuse to put the Wittemberg heretic
to death!</p>

<p>Adrian himself was filled with indignation at the events
in Germany, and it was on the head of the Elector of Saxony
that he discharged his anger. Never had the Roman pontiffs
uttered a cry of alarm more energetic, more sincere, or
perhaps more affecting.</p>

<p>"We have waited long&mdash;and perhaps too long," said the
pious Adrian in the brief he addressed to the elector; "we
were anxious to see whether God would visit thy soul, and
if thou wouldst not at last escape from the snares of Satan.
But when we looked to gather grapes, we found nothing but
sour grapes. The blower hath blown in vain; thy wickedness
is not consumed. Open, then, thine eyes to see the
greatness of thy fall!......</p>

<p>"If the unity of the Church is broken; if the simple have
been turned aside from that faith which they had imbibed
at their mothers' breasts; if the temples are destroyed; if
the people are without priests; if the priests receive not the
honour that is due to them; if Christians are without Christ:
to whom is it owing, but to thee?<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>......If christian peace has
vanished from the earth; if the world is full of discord,
rebellion, robbery, murder, and conflagration; if the cry
of war is heard from east to west; if a universal conflict
is at hand: it is thou&mdash;thou who art the author of these
things!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">FREDERICK'S EMOTION.</div>

<p>"Sawest thou not this sacrilegious man (Luther) rending
with his wicked hands and trampling under his impure feet
the images of the saints and even the holy cross of Christ?......Dost
thou not behold him, in his ungodly wrath, instigating
laymen to imbrue their hands in the blood of the
priests, and overturning the churches of our Lord?</p>

<p>"And what matters it, if the priests he assails are wicked
priests? Has not the Lord said: <i>Whatsoever they bid you
observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works</i>;
thus showing the honour that belongs to them, even when
their lives are blame-worthy.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>"Rebellious apostate! he is not ashamed to defile the
vessels consecrated to God; he drags from their sanctuaries
the holy virgins consecrated to Christ, and gives them over
to the devil; he takes the priests of the Lord, and delivers
them up to infamous harlots......Awful profanation! which
even the heathen would have condemned with horror in the
priests of their idols!</p>

<p>"What punishment, what martyrdom dost thou think we
judge thee to deserve?......Have pity on thyself; have pity
on thy wretched Saxons; for if you do not all return into
the fold, God will pour out his vengeance upon you.</p>

<p>"In the name of the Almighty God, and of our Lord
Jesus Christ, whose representative I am upon earth, I declare
that thou shalt be punished in this world, and plunged
into everlasting fire in that which is to come. Repent
and be converted!......Two swords are suspended over thy
head,&mdash;the sword of the Empire and the sword of the
Church."</p>

<p>The pious Frederick shuddered as he read this threatening
brief. He had written to the emperor shortly before, to the
effect that old age and sickness rendered him incapable of
taking any part in these affairs; and he had been answered
by the most insolent letter that a sovereign prince had ever
received. Although bowed down by age, he cast his eyes
on that sword which he had worn at the holy sepulchre in
the days of his manly strength. He began to think that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
would have to unsheathe it in defence of the conscience of
his subjects, and that, already on the brink of the tomb, he
would not be allowed to go down to it in peace. He immediately
wrote to Wittemberg to hear the opinion of the fathers
of the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OPINIONS OF THE REFORMERS.</div>

<p>There also troubles and persecutions were apprehended.
"What shall I say?" exclaimed the gentle Melancthon;
"whither shall I turn? Hatred overwhelms us, and the
world is transported with fury against us."<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Luther, Linck,
Melancthon, Bugenhagen, and Amsdorff consulted together
on the reply they should make to the elector. Their answer
was almost entirely to the same purport, and the advice they
gave him is very remarkable.</p>

<p>"No prince," said they, "can undertake a war without
the consent of the people, from whose hands he has received
his authority.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Now, the people have no desire to fight for
the Gospel, for they do not believe. Let not princes, therefore,
take up arms; they are rulers of the nations, and therefore
of unbelievers." Thus, it was the impetuous Luther who
counselled the wise Frederick to restore his sword to its
sheath. He could not have returned a better answer to the
reproach of the pope, that he excited the laity to imbrue their
hands in the blood of the clergy. Few characters have been
more misunderstood than his. This advice was dated the
8th of February. Frederick restrained himself.</p>

<p>The pope's wrath soon bore fruit. The princes who had
set forth their grievances against Rome, alarmed at their own
daring, were now desirous of making amends by their compliance.
Many, besides, thought that the victory would
remain with the Roman pontiff, as he appeared to be the
stronger party. "In our days," said Luther, "princes are
content to say three times three make nine; or else, twice
seven make fourteen: The reckoning is correct; the affair
will succeed. Then our Lord God arises and says: How
many do you reckon me?......For a cipher perhaps?......He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
then turns their calculations topsy-turvy, and their accounts
prove false."<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Persecution&mdash;Exertions of Duke George&mdash;The Convent at Antwerp&mdash;Miltenberg&mdash;The
Three Monks of Antwerp&mdash;The Scaffold&mdash;The Martyrs
of Brussels.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">PERSECUTION.</div>

<p>The torrent of fire poured forth by the humble and meek
Adrian kindled a conflagration; and its flickering flames
communicated an immense agitation to the whole of Christendom.
The persecution, which had been for some time relaxed,
broke out afresh. Luther trembled for Germany, and endeavoured
to appease the storm. "If the princes," said he,
"oppose the truth, the result will be a confusion that will
destroy princes and magistrates, priests and people. I fear
to see all Germany erelong deluged with blood.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> Let us
rise up as a wall and preserve our people from the wrath of
our God. Nations are not such now as they have hitherto
been.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> The sword of civil war is impending over the heads
of our kings. They are resolved to destroy Luther; but
Luther is resolved to save them. Christ lives and reigns;
and I shall live and reign with him."<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>These words produced no effect; Rome was hastening
onward to scaffolds and to bloodshed. The Reformation, like
Jesus Christ, did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
Persecution was necessary in God's purposes. As certain
objects are hardened in the fire, to protect them from the
influence of the atmosphere, so the fiery trial was intended
to protect the evangelical truth from the influence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
world. But the fire did still more than this: it served, as
in the primitive times of Christianity, to kindle in men's
hearts a universal enthusiasm for a cause so furiously persecuted.
When man begins to know the truth, he feels a
holy indignation against injustice and violence. A heaven-descended
instinct impels him to the side of the oppressed;
and at the same time the faith of the martyrs exalts, wins,
and leads him to that doctrine which imparts such courage
and tranquillity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUKE GEORGE'S EXERTIONS.</div>

<p>Duke George took the lead in the persecution. But it
was a little thing to carry it on in his own states only; he
desired, above all, that it should devastate electoral Saxony,
that focus of heresy, and spared no labour to move the
Elector Frederick and Duke John. "Merchants from
Saxony," he wrote to them from Nuremberg, "relate strange
things about that country, and such as are opposed to the
honour of God and of the saints: they take the sacrament of
the Lord's Supper with their hands!......The bread and wine
are consecrated <i>in the language of the people</i>; Christ's blood
is put into common vessels; and at Eulenburg, a man to insult
the priest entered the church riding on an ass!......Accordingly,
what is the consequence? The mines with which
God had enriched Saxony have failed since the innovating
sermons of Luther. Would to God that those who boast
of having uplifted the Gospel in the electorate had rather
carried it to Constantinople. Luther's strain is sweet and
pleasing, but there is a poisoned tail, that stings like that
of the scorpion. Let us now prepare for the conflict! Let
us imprison these apostate monks and impious priests; and
that too without delay, for our hair is turning gray as well
as our beards, and shows us that we have but short time
left for action."<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>Thus wrote Duke George to the elector. The latter replied
firmly but mildly, that any one who committed a crime
in his states would meet with due punishment; but that
for what concerned the conscience, such things must be left
to God.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE ANTWERP CONVENT.</div>

<p>George, unable to persuade Frederick, hastened to persecute
the followers of the work he detested. He imprisoned the
monks and priests who followed Luther; he recalled the students
belonging to his states from the universities which the
Reformation had reached; and ordered that all the copies of
the New Testament in the vulgar tongue should be given up
to the magistrates. The same measures were enforced in
Austria, Wurtemberg, and the duchy of Brunswick.</p>

<p>But it was in the Low Countries, under the immediate
authority of Charles V., that the persecution broke out with
greatest violence. The Augustine convent at Antwerp was
filled with monks who had welcomed the truths of the
Gospel. Many of the brethren had passed some time at
Wittemberg, and since 1519, salvation by grace had been
preached in their church with great energy. The prior,
James Probst, a man of ardent temperament, and Melchior
Mirisch, who was remarkable, on the other hand, for his
ability and prudence, were arrested and taken to Brussels
about the close of the year 1521. They were brought before
Aleander, Glapio, and several other prelates. Taken by surprise,
confounded, and alarmed, Probst retracted. Melchior
Mirisch found means to pacify his judges; he escaped both
from recantation and condemnation.</p>

<p>These persecutions did not alarm the monks who remained
in the convent at Antwerp. They continued to preach the
Gospel with power. The people crowded to hear them, and
the church of the Augustines in that city was found too
small, as had been the case with the one at Wittemberg. In
October 1522, the storm that was muttering over their heads
burst forth; the convent was closed, and the monks thrown
into prison and condemned to death.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> A few of them
managed to escape. Some women, forgetting the timidity
of their sex, dragged one of them (Henry Zuphten) from the
hands of the executioners.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Three young monks, Henry
Voes, John Esch, and Lambert Thorn, escaped for a time
the search of the inquisitors. All the sacred vessels of the
convent were sold; the gates were barricaded; the holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
sacrament was removed, as if from a polluted spot; Margaret,
the governor of the Low Countries, solemnly received
it into the church of the Holy Virgin;<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> orders were given
that not one stone should be left upon another of that heretical
monastery; and many citizens and women who had
joyfully listened to the Gospel were thrown into prison.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>Luther was filled with sorrow on hearing this news.
"The cause that we defend," said he, "is no longer a mere
game; it will have blood, it calls for our lives."<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MIRISCH AND PROBST.</div>

<p>Mirisch and Probst were to meet with very different fates.
The prudent Mirisch soon became the docile instrument of
Rome, and the agent of the imperial decrees against the
partisans of the Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Probst, on the contrary,
having escaped from the hands of the inquisitors, wept over
his backsliding; he retracted his retractation, and boldly
preached at Bruges in Flanders the doctrines he had abjured.
Being again arrested and thrown into prison at Brussels, his
death seemed inevitable.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> A Franciscan took pity on him,
and assisted his escape; and Probst, "preserved by a
miracle of God," says Luther, reached Wittemberg, where
his twofold deliverance filled the hearts of the friends to the
Reformation with joy.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MILTENBERG.</div>

<p>On all sides the Roman priests were under arms. The
city of Miltenberg on the Maine, which belonged to the Archbishop
of Mentz, was one of the German towns that had
received the Word of God with the greatest eagerness. The
inhabitants were much attached to their pastor John Draco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
one of the most enlightened men of his times. He was compelled
to leave the city; but the Roman ecclesiastics were
frightened, and withdrew at the same time, fearing the vengeance
of the people. One evangelical deacon alone remained
to comfort their hearts. At the same time troops from
Mentz marched into the city: they spread through the streets,
uttering blasphemies, brandishing their swords, and giving
themselves up to debauchery.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>Some evangelical Christians fell beneath their blows;<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
others were seized and thrown into dungeons; the Romish
rites were restored; the reading of the Bible was prohibited;
and the inhabitants were forbidden to speak of the Gospel,
even in the most private meetings. On the entrance of the
troops, the deacon had taken refuge in the house of a poor
widow. He was denounced to their commanders, who sent
a soldier to apprehend him. The humble deacon, hearing
the hasty steps of the soldier who sought his life, quietly
waited for him, and just as the door of the chamber was
opened abruptly, he went forward meekly, and cordially
embracing him, said: "I welcome thee, brother; here I am;
plunge thy sword into my bosom."<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> The fierce soldier, in
astonishment, let his sword fall from his hands, and protected
the pious evangelist from any further harm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE THREE MONKS OF ANTWERP.</div>

<p>Meantime, the inquisitors of the Low Countries, thirsting
for blood, scoured the country, searching everywhere for the
young Augustines who had escaped from the Antwerp persecution.
Esch, Voes, and Lambert were at last discovered,
put in chains, and led to Brussels. Egmondanus, Hochstraten,
and several other inquisitors, summoned them into
their presence. "Do you retract your assertion," asked
Hochstraten, "that the priest has not the power to forgive
sins, and that it belongs to God alone?" He then proceeded
to enumerate other evangelical doctrines which they
were called upon to abjure. "No! we will retract nothing,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
exclaimed Esch and Voes firmly; "we will not deny the
Word of God; we will rather die for the faith."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Inquisitor.</span>&mdash;"Confess that you have been seduced
by Luther."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Young Augustines.</span>&mdash;"As the apostles were seduced
by Jesus Christ."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Inquisitors.</span>&mdash;"We declare you to be heretics, worthy of
being burnt alive, and we give you over to the secular arm."</p>

<p>Lambert kept silence; the prospect of death terrified him;
distress and doubt tormented his soul. "I beg four days,"
said he with a stifled voice. He was led back to prison.
As soon as this delay had expired, Esch and Voes were
solemnly deprived of their sacerdotal character, and given
over to the council of the governor of the Low Countries.
The council delivered them, fettered, to the executioner.
Hochstraten and three other inquisitors accompanied them to
the stake.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>When they came near the scaffold, the youthful martyrs
looked at it calmly; their firmness, their piety, their age,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
drew tears even from the inquisitors. When they were
bound, the confessors approached them: "Once more we
ask you if you will receive the christian faith."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Martyrs.</span>&mdash;"We believe in the Christian Church, but
not in your Church."</p>

<p>Half an hour elapsed: the inquisitors hesitated, and hoped
that the prospect of so terrible a death would intimidate
these youths. But alone tranquil in the midst of the turbulent
crowd in the square, they sang psalms, stopping from
time to time to declare boldly: "We will die for the name
of Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>"Be converted&mdash;be converted," cried the inquisitors, "or
you will die in the name of the devil."&mdash;"No," replied the
martyrs, "we will die like Christians, and for the truth of
the Gospel."</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARTYRDOM.</div>

<p>The pile was lighted. While the flames were ascending
slowly, a heavenly peace filled their hearts, and one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
went so far as to say: "I seem to be lying on a bed of
roses."<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> The solemn hour was come; death was near:
the two martyrs cried with a loud voice: "<i>O Domine Jesu!
Fili David! miserere nostri!</i> O Lord Jesus, Son of David,
have mercy on us!" They then began solemnly to repeat
the Apostle's Creed.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> At last the flames reached them,
burning the cords that fastened them to the stake, before
their breath was gone. One of them, taking advantage of
this liberty, fell on his knees in the midst of the fire,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> and
thus worshipping his Master, exclaimed, clasping his hands:
"Lord Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on us!" The
flames now surrounded their bodies: they sang the <i>Te

ashes remained.</p>

<p>This execution had lasted four hours. It was on the 1st of
July 1523 that the first martyrs of the Reformation thus
laid down their lives for the Gospel.</p>

<p>All good men shuddered when they heard of it. The
future filled them with the keenest apprehension. "The
executions have begun," said Erasmus.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>&mdash;"At last," exclaimed
Luther, "Christ is gathering some fruits of our
preaching, and has created new martyrs."</p>

<p>But the joy Luther felt at the constancy of these two
young Christians was troubled by the thought of Lambert.
The latter was the most learned of the three; he had succeeded
to Probst's station as preacher at Antwerp. Agitated
in his dungeon, and alarmed at the prospect of death, he was
still more terrified by his conscience, which reproached him
with cowardice, and urged him to confess the Gospel. He
was soon delivered from his fears, and after boldly proclaiming
the truth, died like his brethren.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S SYMPATHY.</div>

<p>A rich harvest sprang from the blood of these martyrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>

you, and the Lord is at our head!" He then commemorated
the death of these young monks in a beautiful hymn, and
soon, in Germany and in the Netherlands, in city and country,
these strains were heard communicating in every direction
an enthusiasm for the faith of these martyrs.</p>

<p>Adrian would doubtless have persisted in these violent
measures; the inutility of his exertions to arrest the reform,
his orthodoxy, his zeal, his austerity, and even his conscientiousness,
would have made him a cruel persecutor. But
this Providence did not permit. He died on the 14th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
September 1523, and the Romans, overjoyed at being delivered
from this stern foreigner, crowned his physician's door
with flowers, and wrote this inscription over it: "To the
saviour of his country."</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLEMENT VII.&mdash;CAMPEGGIO.</div>

<p>Giulio de Medici, cousin to Leo X., succeeded Adrian VI.,
under the name of Clement VII. From the day of his election
there was no more question of religious reform. The new
pope, like many of his predecessors, thought only of upholding
the privileges of the papacy, and of employing its resources
for his own aggrandizement.</p>

<p>Anxious to repair Adrian's blunders, Clement sent to
Nuremberg a legate of his own character, one of the most
skilful prelates of his court, a man of great experience in
public business, and acquainted with almost all the princes
of Germany. Cardinal Campeggio, for such was his name,
after a magnificent reception in the Italian cities on his road,
soon perceived the change that had taken place in the empire.
When he entered Augsburg, he desired, as was usual,
to give his benediction to the people, but they burst into
laughter. This was enough: he entered Nuremberg privately,
without going to the church of St. Sebaldus, where
the clergy awaited him. No priests in sacerdotal ornaments
came out to meet him; no cross was solemnly borne before
him;<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> one would have thought him some private individual
passing along the streets of the city. Everything betokened
that the reign of the papacy was drawing to an end.</p>

<p>The Diet of Nuremberg resumed its sittings in the month of
January 1524. A storm threatened the national government,
owing to the firmness of Frederick. The Swabian league, the
wealthiest cities of the empire, and particularly Charles V., had
sworn his destruction. He was accused of favouring the new
heresy. Accordingly it was resolved to remodify this administration
without retaining one of its former members. Frederick,
overwhelmed with grief, immediately quitted Nuremberg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LEGATE'S REPLY.</div>

<p>The festival of Easter was approaching. Osiander and the
evangelical preachers redoubled their zeal. The former openly
declared in his sermons that Antichrist entered Rome the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
very day when Constantine left it to fix his residence at Constantinople.
The consecration of the palm-branches and
many other ceremonies of this feast were omitted: four thousand
persons received the sacrament in both kinds, and the
Queen of Denmark, the emperor's sister, received it publicly,
in like manner, at the castle. "Ah!" exclaimed the Archduke
Frederick, losing his temper, "would that you were
not my sister!"&mdash;"The same womb bore us," replied the
queen, "and I will sacrifice everything to please you, except
the Word of God."<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>Campeggio shuddered as he witnessed such audacity; but
affecting to despise the laughter of the populace and the discourses
of the preachers, and resting on the authority of the
emperor and of the pope, he reminded the diet of the edict of
Worms, and called upon them to put down the Reformation
by force. At this language many of the princes and deputies
gave vent to their indignation: "What has become of
the list of grievances presented to the pope by the German
nation?" said they to Campeggio. The legate, following his
instructions, assumed an air of candour and surprise, and answered,
"Three copies of that list reached Rome; but we have
received no official communication of it,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> and neither the
pope nor the college of cardinals could believe that such a
paper could have emanated from your lordships. We thought
that it came from some private individuals who had published
it out of hatred to the court of Rome. In consequence
of this I have no instructions on the matter."</p>

<p>The diet was incensed at this reply. If it is thus the pope
receives their representations, they will also know how to
listen to those he addresses to them. "The people," said
many deputies, "are thirsting for the Word of God; and to
take it away, as the edict of Worms enjoins, would cause
torrents of blood to flow."</p>

<div class="sidenote">PLAN OF A SECULAR COUNCIL.</div>

<p>The diet immediately made preparations for replying to
the pope. As they could not repeal the edict of Worms, a
clause was added to it rendering it ineffectual. They said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
"The people must conform with it <i>as far as possible</i>."<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Now
many states had declared it impossible to enforce it. At the
same time, raising up the importunate shade of the councils
of Constance and of Basle, the diet demanded the convocation
of a general council of Christendom to be held in Germany.</p>

<p>The friends of the Reformation did not confine themselves
to this. What could they expect from a council which perhaps
would never be convoked, and which, under all circumstances,
would be composed of bishops from every nation?
Will Germany submit her anti-Romish inclinations
to prelates from France, Spain, Italy, and England? The
government of the nation had already been abolished; for it
a national assembly should be substituted to protect the interests
of the people.</p>

<p>In vain did Hannaart, the Spanish envoy from Charles V.,
and all the partisans of Rome and the emperor, endeavour to
oppose this suggestion; the majority of the diet was immovable.
It was agreed that a diet, a secular assembly, should
meet at Spires, in the month of November, to regulate all
religious questions, and that the states should immediately
instruct their theologians to draw up a list of the controverted
points to be laid before that august assembly.</p>

<p>They forthwith applied to their task. Each province drew
up its memorial, and never had Rome been threatened with
a more terrible explosion. Franconia, Brandenburg, Henneburg,
Windsheim, Wertheim, and Nuremberg, declared
in favour of the Gospel, and against the seven sacraments,
the abuses of the mass, the adoration of saints, and the papal
supremacy. "Here is coin of the right stamp," said Luther.
Not one of the questions that are agitating the popular mind
will be passed by in this national council. The majority will
carry general measures. The unity, independence, and reformation
of Germany will be safe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POPE'S EFFORTS&mdash;BAVARIA.</div>

<p>On being apprized of this, the pope could not restrain his
wrath. What! dare they set up a secular tribunal to decide
on religious questions in direct opposition to his authority!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
If this extraordinary resolution should be carried out, Germany
would doubtless be saved, but Rome would be lost.
A consistory was hastily convened, and from the alarm of
the senators one might have thought the Germans were
marching against the Capitol. "We must take the electoral
hat from Frederick's head," said Aleander. "The kings
of England and Spain must threaten to break off all commercial
intercourse with the free cities," said another cardinal.
The congregation at last decided that the only means
of safety would be in moving heaven and earth to prevent
the meeting at Spires.</p>

<p>The pope immediately wrote to the emperor: "If I am the
first to make head against the storm, it is not because I am
the only one the tempest threatens; but because I am at the
helm. The rights of the empire are yet more invaded than
the dignity of the court of Rome."</p>

<p>While the pope was sending this letter to Castile, he
was endeavouring to procure allies in Germany. He soon
gained over one of the most powerful houses in the empire,
that of the dukes of Bavaria. The edict of Worms had not
been more strictly enforced there than elsewhere, and the
evangelical doctrine had made great progress. But about
the close of the year 1521, the princes of that country, put
in motion by Doctor Eck, chancellor in the university of
Ingolstadt, had drawn nearer to Rome, and had published a
decree enjoining all their subjects to remain faithful to the
religion of their ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>The Bavarian bishops were alarmed at this encroachment
of the secular power. Eck set out for Rome to solicit the pope
for an extension of authority in behalf of the princes. The
pope granted everything, and even conferred on the dukes a
fifth of the ecclesiastical revenues of their country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LEAGUE OF RATISBON.</div>

<p>Thus, at a time when the Reformation possessed no organization,
Roman-catholicism already had recourse to powerful
institutions for its support; and catholic princes, aided by
the pope, laid their hands on the revenues of the Church,
long before the Reformation ventured to touch them. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
must we think of the reproaches the Roman-catholics have
so often made in this respect?</p>

<p>Clement VII. might reckon upon Bavaria to avert the
formidable assembly at Spires. Erelong the Archduke Ferdinand,
the Bishop of Salzburg, and other princes, were
gained in their turn.</p>

<p>But Campeggio desired to go still further: Germany must
be divided into two hostile camps; Germans must be opposed
to Germans.</p>

<p>Some time before, during his residence at Stuttgard, the
legate had concerted with Ferdinand the plan of a league
against the Reformation. "There is everything to be feared
in an assembly where the voice of the people is heard," said
he. "The Diet of Spires may destroy Rome and save Wittemberg.
Let us close our ranks; let us come to an understanding
for the day of battle."<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Ratisbon was fixed upon
as the place of meeting.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the jealousy between the houses of Bavaria
and Austria, Campeggio succeeded in bringing the
Dukes of Bavaria and the Archduke Ferdinand to this city,
at the end of June 1524. They were joined by the Archbishop
of Salzburg and the Bishops of Trent and Ratisbon.
The Bishops of Spires, Bamberg, Augsburg, Strasburg, Basle,
Constance, Freisingen, Passau, and Brixen were present by
deputy.</p>

<p>The legate opened their sittings, describing in forcible language
the dangers threatened by the Reformation both to
princes and clergy. "Let us extirpate heresy and save the
Church," exclaimed he.</p>

<p>The conference lasted fifteen days in the town-hall of
Ratisbon. A grand ball, that continued till daylight, served
to enliven this first Catholic assembly held by the papacy
against the dawning Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> After this, measures
were resolved upon for the destruction of the heretics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEVERITY AND REFORM.</div>

<p>The legate thought that, according to the notorious axiom
of the Council of Constance, no faith should be kept with
heretics,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> and in the mean time he carried out this great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
principle on a small scale. During the sittings of the diet at
Nuremberg, Campeggio had taken a globe and a book from a
poor vendor of astronomical instruments: these he kept, and
refused to make any compensation, because the man was a
Lutheran. Our authority for this incident is the celebrated
Pirckheimer, one of the chief magistrates of Nuremberg.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>The princes and bishops bound themselves to enforce the
edicts of Worms and Nuremberg; to permit no change in
public worship; to tolerate no married priest in their states;
to recall all their subjects who might be studying at Wittemberg;
and to employ every means in their power for the
extirpation of heresy. They enjoined the preachers, in the
interpretation of difficult passages, to rely on the fathers of
the Latin Church, Ambrose, Jerome, Augustine, and Gregory.
Not venturing, in the face of the Reformation, to appeal
to the authority of the schoolmen, they were content to
lay the first foundations of Roman orthodoxy.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, as they could not close their eyes
against the scandals and corrupt morals of the priests,<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> they
agreed on a project of reform, in which they endeavoured to
embrace those German grievances which least concerned the
court of Rome. The priests were forbidden to trade, to
haunt the taverns, "to frequent dances," and to dispute over
their cups about articles of faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROMAN INTRIGUES.</div>

<p>Such was the result of the confederation of Ratisbon.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
Even while taking up arms against the Reformation, Rome
conceded something; and in these decrees we may observe
the first influence of the Reformation of the sixteenth century
to effect an inward renovation of catholicism. The
Gospel cannot display its strength without its enemies endeavouring
to imitate it in some way or another. Emser had
published a translation of the Bible in opposition to Luther's;
Eck his <i>Common-places</i>, by way of counterpoise to Melancthon's;<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
and now Rome was opposing to the Reformation
those partial essays of reform to which modern Romanism is
owing. But all these works were in reality subtle expedients<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
to escape from impending danger; branches plucked indeed
from the tree of the Reformation, but planted in a soil which
killed them; there was no vitality, and never will there be
any vitality in such attempts.</p>

<p>Another fact here occurs to us. The Roman party formed
at Ratisbon the first league that infringed the unity of Germany.
The signal for battle was given from the pope's
camp. Ratisbon was the cradle of this division, this political
rending of their native land, which so many of the
Germans deplore to this hour. The national assembly of
Spires, by sanctioning and generalizing the reform of the
Church, would have secured the unity of the empire. The
conventicle of separatists at Ratisbon for ever divided the
nation into two parties.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>Yet Campeggio's plans did not at first succeed as had been
expected. Few princes answered this appeal. Luther's most
decided adversaries, Duke George of Saxony, the Elector Joachim
of Brandenburg, the ecclesiastical electors, and the imperial
cities, took no part in it. It was felt that the pope's legate
was forming a Romish party in Germany against the nation
itself. Popular sympathies counterbalanced religious antipathies,
and in a short time the <i>Ratisbon reformation</i> became
the laughing-stock of the people. But the first step had been
taken, the example given. It was imagined that it would be
no difficult task eventually to strengthen and enlarge this
Roman league. Those who still hesitated would necessarily
be drawn into it by the progress of events. To the legate
Campeggio belongs the glory of having dug the mine which
was most seriously to endanger the liberties of Germany, the
existence of the empire, and of the Reformation. Henceforward
Luther's cause ceased to be a mere religious affair; the
dispute with the monk of Wittemberg ranked among the
political events of Europe. Luther is about to be eclipsed;
and Charles V., the pope, and the princes will be the principal
actors on the stage where the grand drama of the sixteenth
century is to be performed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EDICT OF BURGOS&mdash;RUPTURE.</div>

<p>Yet the assembly at Spires was still kept in view; it might
repair the mischief that Campeggio had effected at Ratisbon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Rome made every exertion to prevent it. "What!" said the
papal deputies, not only to Charles V. but also to Henry
VIII. and other princes of Christendom, "What! do these
insolent Germans pretend to decide points of faith in a national
assembly? It would seem that kings, the imperial authority,
all Christendom, and the whole world, should submit
to their decrees!"</p>

<p>The moment was well chosen to act upon the emperor.
The war between this prince and Francis I. was at its height.
Pescara and the Constable of Bourbon had quitted Italy,
and entering France in the month of May, had laid siege to
Marseilles. The pope, who looked with an evil eye on this
attack, might make a powerful diversion in the rear of the
imperial army. Charles, who must have feared to displease
him, did not hesitate, and immediately sacrificed the independence
of the empire to the favour of Rome and the success
of his struggle with France.</p>

<p>On the 15th of July, Charles issued an edict from Burgos
in Castile, wherein he declared, with an imperious and angry
tone, "that the pope alone had the right of convoking a
council, and the emperor of demanding one; that the meeting
appointed to take place at Spires could not and ought
not to be tolerated; that it was strange the German nation
should undertake a task which all the other nations in the
universe, even with the pope's guidance, would not have the
right of doing; and that they should hasten to enforce the
decree of Worms against the new Mahomet."</p>

<p>Thus came from Spain and Italy the blow that arrested
in Germany the development of the Gospel. Charles was
not yet satisfied. In 1519, he had proposed to unite his
sister, the Archduchess Catherine, to John Frederick, son of
Duke John, the elector's brother, and heir to the electorate.
But was it not this Saxon house that supported in Germany
those principles of religious and political independence which
Charles hated? He decided on breaking off entirely with
the troublesome and guilty representative of the evangelical
and national ideas, and gave his sister in marriage to John
III., king of Portugal. Frederick, who in 1519 had shown
his indifference to the overtures of the King of Spain, was
able in 1524 to suppress the indignation he felt at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
emperor's conduct; but Duke John haughtily intimated that
this proceeding had wounded his feelings very deeply.</p>

<p>Thus the two hostile camps that were destined to rend the
empire for so long a period became daily more distinct.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Persecution&mdash;Gaspard Tauber&mdash;A Bookseller&mdash;Cruelties in Wurtemberg,
Salzburg, and Bavaria&mdash;Pomerania&mdash;Henry of Zuphten.</p></blockquote>


<p>The Roman party was not satisfied with this. The alliance
of Ratisbon was not to be a mere form; it must be sealed
with blood. Ferdinand and Campeggio descended the Danube
together from Ratisbon to Vienna, and during their
journey bound each other by cruel promises. The persecution
immediately broke out in the Austrian states.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARTYRDOM OF GASPARD TAUBER.</div>

<p>One Gaspard Tauber, a citizen of Vienna, had circulated
Luther's writings, and had even written against the invocation
of saints, purgatory, and transubstantiation.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Being
thrown into prison, he was summoned by his judges, both
theologians and lawyers, to retract his errors. It was thought
that he had consented, and every preparation was made in
Vienna to gratify the people with this solemn spectacle. On
the festival of St Mary's nativity, two pulpits were erected
in St Stephen's cemetery, one for the leader of the choir, who
was to extol by his chants the repentance of the heretic;
and the other for Tauber himself. The formula of recantation
was placed in his hands;<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> the people and choristers
waited in silence. Whether Tauber had made no promise,
or whether at the moment of abjuration his faith suddenly
revived with fresh energy, he exclaimed, "I am not convinced,
and I appeal to the holy Roman empire!" Clergy,
choristers, and people were seized with astonishment and
alarm. But Tauber continued to call for death rather than
that he should deny the Gospel. He was decapitated, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
body burnt;<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> and his courage made an indelible impression
on the inhabitants of Vienna.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PERSECUTIONS IN HUNGARY AND WURTEMBERG.</div>

<p>At Buda in Hungary, an evangelical bookseller, named
John, had circulated Luther's New Testament and other of
his writings throughout that country. He was bound to a
stake; his persecutors then piled his books around him, enclosing
him as if in a tower, and then set fire to them. John
manifested unshaken courage, exclaiming from the midst of
the flames, that he was delighted to suffer in the cause of the
Lord.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> "Blood follows blood," cried Luther, when informed
of this martyrdom, "but that generous blood, which Rome
loves to shed, will at last suffocate the pope with his kings
and their kingdoms."<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>Fanaticism grew fiercer every day; evangelical ministers
were expelled from their churches; magistrates were banished;
and at times the most horrible punishments were
inflicted. In Wurtemberg, an inquisitor named Reichler
caused the Lutherans, and above all the preachers, to be
hanged upon trees. Barbarous ruffians were found who
unfeelingly nailed the pastors by their tongues to a post;
so that these unhappy victims, tearing themselves violently
from the wood to which they were fastened, were horribly
mutilated in attempting to recover their liberty, and thus
deprived of that gift which they had long used to proclaim
the Gospel.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BAVARIAN PERSECUTIONS.</div>

<p>Similar persecutions took place in the other states of the
catholic league. An evangelical minister in the neighbourhood
of Salzburg was led to prison, where he was to pass the
rest of his days; whilst the police who had him in charge
were drinking at an alehouse on the road, two young
peasants, moved with compassion, eluded their vigilance,
and delivered the pastor. The anger of the archbishop
was inflamed against these poor people, and without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
form of trial they were ordered to be beheaded. They were
secretly led outside the town early in the morning; and when
they arrived on the plain where they were to die, the executioner
himself hesitated, for (said he) they have not been
tried. "Do what I command you," harshly replied the
archbishop's emissary, "and leave the responsibility to the
prince!" and the heads of these youthful liberators immediately
fell beneath the sword.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>The persecution was most violent in the states of the
Duke of Bavaria: priests were deprived of their office;
nobles driven from their castles; spies filled the whole country;
and in every heart reigned mistrust and alarm. As Bernard
Fichtel, a magistrate, was going to Nuremberg on the duke's
business, on the high-road he fell in with Francis Burkhardt,
professor at Ingolstadt, and one of Dr. Eck's friends. Burkhardt
accosted him, and they travelled together. After
supper the professor began to talk of religion; Fichtel, who
was no stranger to his fellow-traveller, reminded him that
the new edict prohibited such conversations. "Between
us," replied Burkhardt, "there is nothing to fear."&mdash;Upon
this Fichtel remarked: "I do not think this edict can ever
be enforced." He then proceeded to express himself in an
ambiguous manner on purgatory, and said it was a horrible
thing to punish religious differences with death. At these
words Burkhardt could not contain himself: "What is more
just," said he, "than to cut off the heads of all these
Lutheran rascals!" He took a friendly leave of Fichtel, but
immediately denounced him. Fichtel was thrown into
prison, and the wretched man, who had never thought of
becoming a martyr, and whose religious convictions were
not very deep, only escaped death by a shameful retractation.
There was no security in any place, not even in the
bosom of a friend.</p>

<p>But others met with that death from which Fichtel
escaped. In vain was the Gospel preached in secret;<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> the
dukes tracked it in its obscurity and mystery,&mdash;beneath the
domestic roof and in the lonely fields.</p>

<p>"The cross and persecution reign in Bavaria," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Luther; "these wild beasts are lashing themselves into
madness."<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>Even the north of Germany was not free from these
cruelties. Bogislaus, duke of Pomerania, being dead, his son,
who had been brought up at Duke George's court, persecuted
the Gospel; Suaven and Knipstrow were compelled to flee.</p>

<p>But it was in Holstein that one of the most extraordinary
instances of fanaticism occurred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HENRY VON ZUPHTEN.</div>

<p>Henry von Zuphten, who had escaped, as we have seen,
from the convent at Antwerp, was preaching the Gospel at
Bremen; Nicholas Boye, pastor of Mehldorf in the Dittmarsh,
and several pious men of that district, invited him to
come and proclaim Jesus Christ among them. He complied
with their wishes. Immediately the prior of the Dominicans
and the vicar of the official of Hamburg consulted together.
"If he preaches and the people listen to him," said they,
"all is lost!" The prior, after passing an agitated night,
rose early and repaired to the barren and uncultivated heath
where the forty-eight regents of the country were wont to
hold their meetings. "The monk of Bremen is come to ruin
all the Dittmarshers," said he to them. These forty-eight
simple-minded and ignorant men, being persuaded that they
would acquire great renown by delivering the world from
the heretical monk, resolved on putting him to death, without
having either seen or heard him.</p>

<p>This was on Saturday, and the prior wished to prevent
Henry from preaching on the following day. He arrived at
the pastor Boye's dwelling in the middle of the night with
the letter of the forty-eight regents. "If it be God's will that
I should die among the Dittmarshers," said Henry von
Zuphten, "heaven is as near me there as elsewhere;<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> I will
preach."</p>

<p>He went up into the pulpit and preached with great energy.
His hearers, moved and excited by his christian eloquence,
had scarcely left the church when the prior handed them the
letter of the forty-eight regents, forbidding the monk to
preach. They immediately sent their representatives to the
heath; and, after a long discussion, the Dittmarshers agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
that, considering their great ignorance, they would wait until
Easter. But the incensed prior went up to some of the
regents and inflamed their zeal afresh. "We will write to
him," said they.&mdash;"Mind what you are about," replied the
prior; "if he begins to speak, we shall be able to do nothing
with him. We must seize him during the night, and burn
him before he can open his mouth."</p>

<p>They determined to adopt this course. At nightfall on the
day after the Festival of the Conception, the <i>Ave Maria</i> bell
was rung. At this signal, all the neighbouring villagers assembled,
to the number of five hundred, and their leaders
having broached three butts of Hamburg beer, by this means
inspired them with great courage. It was striking midnight
when they reached Mehldorf;&mdash;the peasants were armed;&mdash;the
monks carried torches;&mdash;all marched in disorder, exchanging
shouts of fury. As they entered the village, they
kept deep silence for fear Henry should escape.</p>

<p>On a sudden the gates of the parsonage were burst open;
the drunken peasants rushed in, striking everything they
saw; dishes, kettles, flagons, clothing, were tossed about
pell-mell; they seized on all the gold and silver they could
find, and falling on the poor pastor, they beat him, with loud
cries of "Kill him! kill him!" and then flung him into the
mud. But it was Henry they were seeking; they pulled him
out of bed, tied his hands behind his back, and dragged him
after them, without clothing, and in a piercing cold night
"Why did you come here," said they. As Henry answered
mildly, they cried out, "Down with him! down with him!
if we listen to him we shall become heretics also!" They
had dragged him naked through the ice and snow; his feet
were bleeding; he entreated to be set on horseback. "Yes,
indeed," replied they, mocking him, "we will find horses
for heretics!......March!"&mdash;And they continued hurrying
him towards the heath. A woman, standing at the door of
her cottage as the servant of God was passing, began to
weep. "My good woman," said Henry, "do not weep for
me." The bailiff pronounced his condemnation. Upon this
one of the madmen who had dragged him hither struck the
preacher of Jesus Christ on the head with a sword; another
gave him a blow with a club; after which they brought him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
a poor monk to receive his confession. "Brother," said
Henry, "have I ever done you any wrong?"&mdash;"None," replied
the monk.&mdash;"In that case I have nothing to confess to
you," resumed Henry, "and you have nothing to forgive
me." The monk retired in confusion. Several ineffectual
attempts were made to kindle the pile; the logs would not
catch fire. For two hours the martyr remained thus before
the furious peasantry,&mdash;calm, and raising his eyes to heaven.
While they were binding him to throw him into the flames, he
began the confession of his faith. "Burn first," said a peasant,
striking him on the mouth with his fist, "and then
you may speak!" They tried to fling him on the pile, but
he fell on one side. John Holme, seizing a club, struck him
upon the breast, and he was laid dead on the burning
heap. "Such is the true history of the sufferings of the holy
martyr, Henry von Zuphten."<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Divisions&mdash;The Lord's Supper&mdash;Two Extremes&mdash;Hoen's Discovery&mdash;Carlstadt&mdash;Luther&mdash;Mysticism
of the enthusiasts&mdash;Carlstadt at Orlamund&mdash;Luther's
Mission&mdash;Interview at Table&mdash;The Conference of
Orlamund&mdash;Carlstadt banished.</p></blockquote>


<p>While the Roman party was everywhere drawing the
sword against the Reformation, this work underwent new
developments. It is not at Zurich or at Geneva, but in
Wittemberg, the focus of the Lutheran revival, that we
should look for the commencement of that reformed Church,
of which Calvin became the chief doctor. These two great
families had slept in the same cradle. Union ought
in like manner to have crowned their mature age. But
when the question of the Lord's Supper was once started,
Luther violently rejected the reformed element, and bound
himself and his Church in an exclusive Lutheranism. The
vexation he felt at this rival doctrine caused him to lose
much of his natural kindness of disposition, and aroused in
him a mistrust, an habitual discontent and irritation, to
which he had hitherto been a stranger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TWO EXTREMES.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>The controversy broke out between the two old friends,
the two champions who had fought side by side at Leipsic
against Rome,&mdash;between Carlstadt and Luther. In each of
them their attachment to contrary doctrines originated in a
turn of mind that merits our esteem. In fact, there are two
extremes in questions of religion; the one materializes, the
other spiritualizes everything. The former of these two
extremes is that of Rome; the latter, of the Mystics. Religion,
like man himself, is compounded of body and soul; the
pure idealists as well as the materialists, in religious views
no less than in philosophical systems, are equally mistaken.</p>

<p>Such is the great question hidden under the discussion
about the Lord's Supper. While on a superficial glance we
see nothing but a trivial dispute about words, a deeper observation
discloses to us one of the most important controversies
that can occupy the human mind.</p>

<p>Here the reformers divide into two parties; but each
carries away with it a portion of the truth. Luther and
his followers intend opposing an exaggerated spiritualism;
Carlstadt and the reformed attack a hateful materialism.
Each of them arraigns the error which in his view
appears the most fatal, and, in assailing it, possibly goes beyond
the truth. But this is of no importance; each of them
is true in his general tendency, and although belonging to
two different hosts, these two illustrious teachers both take
their stand under one common banner,&mdash;that of Jesus Christ,
who alone is Truth in its infinite extent.</p>

<p>Carlstadt thought that nothing could be more injurious to
real piety than confidence in outward ceremonies and in a
certain magical influence of the sacraments. The outward
participation in the Lord's Supper, according to Rome, was
sufficient for salvation, and this principle had materialized
religion. Carlstadt saw no better way of restoring its spirituality
than by denying all presence of Christ's body: and he
taught that this holy feast was to believers simply a pledge
of their redemption.</p>

<p>Did Carlstadt arrive at these opinions unaided? No: all
things are bound together in the Church; and the historical
filiation of the reformed doctrine, so long overlooked, now
appears clearly established. Unquestionably we cannot fail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
to see in this doctrine the sentiments of several of the
Fathers; but if we search in the long chain of ages for the
link which more immediately connects that of Carlstadt and
the Swiss reformers, we shall find it in John Wessel, the
most illustrious doctor of the fifteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HOEN'S DISCOVERY.</div>

<p>A christian lawyer of Holland, Cornelius Hoen (Honius),
a friend of Erasmus, and who had been thrown into prison
in 1523 for his attachment to the Gospel, found among the
papers of James Hoek, dean of Naeldwik, and a great friend
of Wessel, several treatises by this illustrious doctor touching
the Lord's Supper.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Hoen, convinced of the truth of the
spiritual sense ascribed by Wessel to this sacrament, thought
it his duty to communicate to the reformers these papers
written by his fellow-countryman. He therefore transmitted
them to two of his friends, John Rhodius, president of the
brethren of the Common-life at Utrecht, and George Sagarus
or Saganus, together with a letter on the same subject, and
desired them to lay all of them before Luther.</p>

<p>About the close of the year 1520, the two Dutchmen arrived
at Wittemberg, where they seem to have been favourably
received by Carlstadt from the first moment; while Luther, as
was his custom, invited these foreign friends to meet some of
his colleagues at dinner. The conversation naturally fell on the
treasure these Netherlanders had brought with them, and particularly
on the writings of Wessel concerning the Lord's Supper.</p>

<p>Rhodius invited Luther to receive the doctrine that the
great doctor of the fifteenth century had so clearly set forth,
and Carlstadt entreated his friend to acknowledge the spiritual
signification of the Eucharist, and even to write against
the carnal eating of Christ's body. Luther shook his head
and refused, upon which Carlstadt exclaimed warmly:
"Well, then, if you will not do it, I will, although far less
fitted than yourself." Such was the beginning of the division
that afterwards occurred between these two colleagues.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
The two Netherlanders, being rejected in Saxony, resolved to
turn their steps towards Switzerland, where we shall meet
with them again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CARLSTADT AND LUTHER&mdash;MYSTICISM.</div>

<p>Luther henceforward took a diametrically opposite direction.
At first, he had apparently contended in favour of the opinion
we have just pointed out. In his treatise on the mass, which
appeared in 1520, he said: "I can every day partake of the
sacraments, if I only call to mind the words and promises of
Christ, and if I nourish and strengthen my faith with them."
Neither Carlstadt, Zwingle, nor Calvin, have ever used
stronger language than this. It would even appear that
the idea frequently occurred to him at this period, that a symbolical
explanation of the Lord's Supper would be the most
powerful weapon to overturn the papal system from top to
bottom; for he said in 1525, that five years previously he
had undergone many severe temptations for this doctrine,<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
and that the man who could have proved to him that there
was only bread and wine in the eucharist, would have done
him the greatest service.</p>

<p>But new circumstances threw him into an opposition, at
times not unmingled with violence, against those very
opinions to which he had made so near an approach. The
fanaticism of the enthusiasts of the day explains the direction
Luther now took. They were not content with under-valuing
what they called the external Word, that is, the
Bible, and with pretending to special revelations from the
Holy Ghost; they went so far as to despise the sacrament
of the Lord's Supper, as something outward, and to speak of
an inward communion as being the only true communion.
From that time, in every attempt made to explain the doctrine
of the Lord's Supper in a symbolical manner, Luther
saw only the danger of weakening the authority of the Holy
Scriptures; of substituting arbitrary allegories for their real
meaning; of spiritualizing everything in religion; of making it
consist, not in the gifts of God, but in the impressions of men;
and of substituting by this means for the true Christianity a
mysticism, a theosophy, a fanaticism, that would infallibly become
its grave. We must acknowledge that, had it not been
for Luther's violent opposition, the mystical, enthusiastic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and subjective tendency would then perhaps have made
rapid progress, and would have turned back the tide of blessings
that the Reformation was to spread over the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CARLSTADT AT ORLAMUND.</div>

<p>Carlstadt, impatient at being prevented from explaining
his doctrine freely in Wittemberg, urged by his conscience to
combat a system which in his "opinion lowered Christ's death
and destroyed his righteousness," resolved "to give a public
testimony for the love of poor and cruelly deceived Christendom."
He left Wittemberg at the beginning of 1524,
without informing either the university or the chapter of his
intentions, and repaired to the small town of Orlamund, the
church of which was placed under his superintendence. He
had the incumbent dismissed, got himself nominated pastor
in his stead, and in despite of the chapter, the university,
and the elector, established himself in this new post.</p>

<p>He soon began to propagate his doctrine. "It is impossible,"
said he, "to find in the real presence any advantage
that does not proceed from faith; it is therefore useless." In
explaining Christ's words at the institution of the Lord's
Supper, he had recourse to an interpretation which is not
admitted by the reformed Churches. Luther, in the disputation
at Leipsic, had explained these words: <i>Thou art Peter,
and on this rock I will build my Church</i>, by separating the
two propositions, and applying the latter to our Saviour's
person. "In like manner," said Carlstadt, "the words,
<i>take</i>, <i>eat</i>, refer to the bread; but <i>this is my body</i> relates to
Jesus Christ, who then pointed to himself, and intimated by
the symbol of breaking the bread, that his body was soon to
be broken."</p>

<div class="sidenote">INTERVIEW BETWEEN LUTHER AND CARLSTADT.</div>

<p>Carlstadt did not stop here. He was scarcely emancipated
from the guardianship of Luther, before he felt his zeal
revive against the images. It was easy for his imprudent
discourses and his enthusiastic language to inflame men's
minds in these agitated times. The people, imagining they
heard a second Elijah, broke the idols of Baal. The excitement
soon spread to the surrounding villages. The elector
would have interfered; but the peasants replied that they
ought to obey God rather than man. Upon this, the prince
determined to send Luther to Orlamund to restore peace.
Luther regarded Carlstadt as a man eaten up by a love of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
notoriety,<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> a fanatic who might be so far carried away as to
make war on Christ himself. Frederick might perhaps have
made a wiser choice. Luther departed, and Carlstadt was
fated to see this troublesome rival once more come and disturb
his plans of reform, and check his soaring flight.</p>

<p>Jena was on the road to Orlamund. Luther reached this
city on the 23d of August, and on the 24th went into the
pulpit at seven in the morning; he spoke for an hour and a
half in the presence of a numerous auditory against fanaticism,
rebellion, the breaking of images, and the contempt of
the real presence, inveighing most energetically against the
innovations of Orlamund. He did not mention Carlstadt by
name, but every one could see whom he had in view.</p>

<p>Carlstadt, either by accident or design, was at Jena, and
among the number of Luther's hearers. He did not hesitate
to seek an explanation of this sermon. Luther was dining
with the prior of Wittemberg, the burgomaster, the town-clerk,
the pastor of Jena, and several officers of the emperor
and the margrave, when he received a letter from Carlstadt
demanding an interview; he handed it to his neighbours,
and replied to the bearer: "If Doctor Carlstadt wishes to
come to me, let him come; if not, I can do without him."
Carlstadt came. His visit produced a lively sensation in the
whole party. The majority, eager to see the two lions battling,
suspended their repast and looked on, while the more
timid turned pale with alarm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CHALLENGE.</div>

<p>Carlstadt, on Luther's invitation, took a seat in front of
him and said: "Doctor, in your sermon of this morning
you classed me with those who inculcate rebellion and
assassination. Such a charge I declare to be false."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"I did not name you; but since the cap fits,
you may wear it."</p>

<p>After a brief pause Carlstadt resumed:</p>

<p>"I will undertake to prove that on the doctrine of the sacrament
you have contradicted yourself, and that no one, since
the days of the apostles, has taught it so purely as myself."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"Write! combat my opinions!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carlstadt.</span>&mdash;"I offer you a public disputation at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Wittemberg or at Erfurth, if you will procure me a safe-conduct."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"Fear nothing, doctor."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carlstadt.</span>&mdash;"You bind me hand and foot, and when you
have rendered me unable to defend myself, you strike me."<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>There was another brief silence, when Luther resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Write against me, but openly and not in secret."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carlstadt.</span>&mdash;"I would do so, if I knew that you were
speaking sincerely."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"Do so, and I will give you a florin."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carlstadt.</span>&mdash;"Give it me; I accept the challenge."</p>

<p>At these words Luther took a gold florin out of his
pocket, and giving it to Carlstadt, said: "There is the
money: now strike boldly."</p>

<p>Carlstadt holding the florin in his hand, turned towards the
assembly and said: "Dear brethren, this is my earnest-money,
a warrant that I have authority to write against
Doctor Luther; be you all witnesses to this."</p>

<p>Then bending the florin that it might be known again, he
put it in his purse and shook hands with Luther, who drank
his health, to which Carlstadt responded. "The more vigorous
your attack, the better I shall like it," resumed Luther.</p>

<p>"If I miss you," replied Carlstadt, "it shall be through no
fault of mine."</p>

<p>They once more shook hands, and Carlstadt returned to
his dwelling.</p>

<p>Thus, says an historian, as from a single spark often proceeds
the conflagration of a whole forest, so from this small
beginning a great division arose in the Church.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER AND CARLSTADT AT ORLAMUND.</div>

<p>Luther set out for Orlamund, and arrived there very ill
prepared by the scene at Jena. He assembled the council
and the church, and said: "Neither the elector nor the university
will acknowledge Carlstadt as your pastor."&mdash;"If
Carlstadt is not our pastor," replied the treasurer of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
town-council, "St. Paul is a false teacher, and your books
are full of falsehoods, for we have elected him."</p>

<p>As he said this, Carlstadt entered the room. Some of
those who were near Luther beckoned him to sit down, but
Carlstadt, going straight up to Luther, said: "Dear doctor,
if you will allow me, I will entertain you."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"You are my opponent. I gave you a gold
florin for that purpose."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carlstadt.</span>&mdash;"I will be your opponent so long as you
remain the enemy of God and of his truth."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"Leave the room: I cannot allow you to be
present here."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carlstadt.</span>&mdash;"This is a public meeting. If your cause is
good, why should you fear me?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther</span> <i>to his servant</i>.&mdash;"Go and put the horses to; I
have nothing to do with Carlstadt, and since he will not leave,
I must."<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>At the same time Luther rose from his seat, upon which
Carlstadt quitted the room.</p>

<p>After a short pause, Luther resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Prove by Scripture that we ought to destroy the images."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Councillor</span>, <i>opening a Bible</i>.&mdash;"Doctor, you will grant
me, however, that Moses knew God's commandments?
Well, then, here are his words: <i>Thou shalt not make unto
thee any graven image, or any likeness</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"This passage refers only to idolatrous images.
If I have a crucifix hung up in my chamber, and do not
worship it, what harm can it do me?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Shoemaker.</span>&mdash;"I have frequently taken off my hat
before an image that I have seen in a room or in the streets.
It is an idolatrous act that deprives God of the glory that is
due to him alone."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luther.</span>&mdash;"Must we then, because of their abuse, put
our women to death, and throw our wine into the streets?"<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another Member of the Church.</span>&mdash;"No! these are
God's creatures, which we are not commanded to destroy."</p>

<div class="sidenote">CARLSTADT'S BANISHMENT.</div>

<p>After the conference had lasted some time longer, Luther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and his friends returned to their carriage, astonished at what
they had seen, and without having succeeded in convincing
the inhabitants, who claimed for themselves the right of
freely interpreting and explaining the Scriptures. The excitement
was very great in Orlamund; the people insulted
Luther, and some of them shouted out: "Begone, in the
name of all the devils! May you break your neck before
you get out of our city!"<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> Never had the reformer undergone
such humiliation.</p>

<p>He proceeded thence to Kale, where the pastor had also
embraced the doctrines of Carlstadt, and resolved to preach
there. But when he entered the pulpit, he found the fragments
of a crucifix. At first his emotion was very great;
but recovering himself, he gathered up the pieces into a
corner, and delivered a sermon without a single allusion to
this circumstance. He said at a later period: "I determined
to revenge myself on the devil by contempt."</p>

<p>The nearer the elector approached the end of his days, the
more he feared lest men should go too far in the Reformation.
He gave orders that Carlstadt should be deprived of
his offices, and that he should not only leave Orlamund, but
the electoral states also. In vain did the church of this place
intercede in his favour; in vain did they ask that he might
be allowed to remain among them as a private citizen, with
permission to preach occasionally; in vain did they represent
that they valued God's truth more than the whole
world, or even a thousand worlds,<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> if God had created as
many: Frederick was inflexible, and he even went so far as
to refuse Carlstadt the funds necessary for his journey.
Luther had nothing to do with these severe measures of the
prince; they were far from his disposition, as he showed at
a later period. But Carlstadt looked upon him as the author
of all his misfortunes, and filled Germany with his complaints
and lamentations. He wrote a farewell address to his friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
at Orlamund. The people were called together by the ringing
of the bells; and the letter, which was read to the assembled
church, drew tears from every eye.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> It was signed,
"Andrew Bodenstein, expelled by Luther, unheard and unconvicted."</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S DEJECTION&mdash;CARLSTADT'S TRAVELS.</div>

<p>We cannot but feel pain at seeing the contest between
these two men, who once were friends, and who were both so
excellent. A feeling of sadness took possession of all the
disciples of the Reformation. What would become of it now
that its most illustrious defenders thus opposed each other?
Luther noticed these fears, and endeavoured to allay them.
"Let us fight," said he, "as if fighting for another. The
cause is God's, the care is God's, the work is God's, the victory
is God's, and to God belongs the glory!<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> He will contend
and conquer without us. Let that fall which ought to
fall; let that stand which ought to stand. It is not our own
cause that is at stake, nor our own glory that we seek."</p>

<p>Carlstadt took refuge at Strasburg, where he published
several works. He was a sound Latin, Greek, and Hebrew
scholar, says Dr. Scheur; and Luther acknowledged his
superior erudition. Endowed with an elevated mind, he
sacrificed his reputation, his rank, his home, his very bread,
to his convictions. He afterwards proceeded to Switzerland;
it is there he should have commenced his teaching: his independence
needed the free air in which Zwingle and &OElig;colampadius
breathed. His doctrine soon awakened almost
as much attention as that obtained by Luther's first theses.
Switzerland appeared to be won; Bucer and Capito seemed
to be carried away by it.</p>

<p>Luther's indignation was then at its height, and he published
one of the most powerful, but at the same time one
of his most violent controversial works&mdash;his book "<i>Against
the Celestial Prophets</i>."</p>

<p>Thus the Reformation, attacked by the pope, attacked by
the emperor, attacked by the princes, was beginning also to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
tear its own vitals. It seemed that it must fall under the
weight of so many evils; and assuredly it would have fallen
had it been a work of man. But soon from the very brink
of destruction it rose up with renewed energy.</p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Progress&mdash;Resistance against the Ratisbon Leaguers&mdash;Meeting between
Philip of Hesse and Melancthon&mdash;The Landgrave converted to the
Gospel&mdash;The Palatinate&mdash;Luneburg&mdash;Holstein&mdash;The Grand-Master at
Wittemberg.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">RESISTANCE TO THE LEAGUE OF RATISBON.</div>

<p>The Catholic League of Ratisbon and the persecutions that
followed it, created a powerful reaction among the German
people. They did not feel disposed to suffer themselves to
be deprived of that Word of God which had been restored to
them at last; and to the orders of Charles V., to the bulls
of the pope, the menaces and burning piles of Ferdinand and
the other Roman-catholic princes, they replied: "We will
keep it!"</p>

<p>No sooner had the members of the league quitted Ratisbon,
than the deputies of the towns, whose bishops had
taken part in this alliance, in surprise and indignation met
at Spires, and declared that their ministers in despite of the
prohibition of the bishops should preach the Gospel, and
nothing but the Gospel, conformably to the doctrine of the
prophets and apostles. They then proceeded to draw up a
memorial in firm and consistent language, to be laid before
the national assembly.</p>

<p>The imperial letter from Burgos, it is true, came to disturb
their minds. Nevertheless, about the close of the year,
the deputies of these cities with many nobles met at Ulm,
and swore to assist one another in case of attack.</p>

<p>Thus to the camp formed by Austria, Bavaria, and the
bishops, the free cities immediately opposed another in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
they planted the standard of the Gospel and of the national
liberties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MEETING OF THE TWO PHILIPS.</div>

<p>While the cities were thus placing themselves in the van
of the Reformation, many princes were gained over to its
cause. In the beginning of the month of June 1524, as
Melancthon was returning on horseback from a visit to his
mother, accompanied by Camerarius and some other friends,
he met a brilliant train near Frankfort. It was Philip, landgrave
of Hesse, who three years before had called on Luther at
Worms, and who was then on his road to the tournament at
Heidelberg, where all the princes of Germany would be present.</p>

<p>Thus did Providence bring Philip successively into contact
with the two reformers. As it was known that the celebrated
doctor had gone to his native place, one of the landgrave's
attendants said: "It is Philip Melancthon, I think." The
young prince immediately clapped spurs to his horse, and
coming near the doctor said: "Is your name Philip?"&mdash;"It
is," replied the scholar a little intimidated, and respectfully
preparing to alight.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> "Keep your seat," said the prince;
"turn round, and come and pass the night with me; there
are some matters on which I desire to have a little talk with
you; fear nothing."&mdash;"What can I fear from such a prince
as you?" replied the doctor.&mdash;"Ah! ah!" said the landgrave
with a laugh, "if I were to carry you off and give you up
to Campeggio, he would not be offended, I think." The two
Philips rode on together, side by side, the prince asking
questions and the doctor replying. The landgrave was delighted
with the clear and impressive views set before him
by Melancthon. The latter at length begged permission to
continue his journey, and Philip of Hesse parted from him
with reluctance. "On one condition," said he, "that on your
return home you will carefully examine the questions we
have been discussing, and send me the result in writing."<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
Melancthon gave his promise. "Go then," said Philip,
"and pass through my states."</p>

<div class="sidenote">PHILIP OF HESSE&mdash;NOBLE PROSELYTES.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>Melancthon drew up with his usual talent an <i>Abridgment
of the Revived Doctrine of Christianity</i>;<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> a forcible and concise
treatise, that made a decided impression on the landgrave's
mind. Shortly after his return from the tournament
at Heidelberg, this prince, without joining the free cities,
published an edict by which, in opposition to the league of
Ratisbon, he ordered the Gospel to be preached in all its
purity. He embraced it himself with the energy peculiar to
his character. "Rather would I give up my body and life,
my subjects and my states," said he, "than the Word of
God." A Minorite friar, named Ferber, perceiving this
prince's leaning towards the Reformation, wrote him a
letter full of reproach, in which he conjured him to remain
faithful to Rome. "I will remain faithful to the old doctrine,"
replied Philip, "but such as it is contained in Scripture."
He then proved very forcibly that man is justified
solely by faith. Astonishment kept the monk silent.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> The
landgrave was commonly styled "Melancthon's disciple."<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>Other princes followed in the same direction. The elector-palatine
refused to lend himself to any persecution; the
Duke of Luneburg, nephew to the Elector of Saxony, began
to reform his own states; and the King of Denmark gave
orders that in Sleswick and Holstein every one should be
free to serve God as his conscience suggested.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GRAND-MASTER OF THE TEUTONIC KNIGHTS.</div>

<p>The Reformation gained a still more important victory.
A prince, whose conversion to the Gospel was destined to
exert the greatest influence, even in our days, began about
this time to turn aside from Rome. One day about the
end of June, shortly after Melancthon's return to Wittemberg,
Albert, margrave of Brandenburg and grand-master of
the Teutonic order, entered Luther's chamber. This chief of
the military monks of Germany, who then possessed Prussia,
had gone to the Diet of Nuremberg to invoke the aid of the
empire against Poland. He returned in the deepest distress.
On the one hand, the preaching of Osiander and the reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of the Bible had convinced him that his monastic profession
was contrary to the Word of God; and on the other the
fall of the national government in Germany had deprived
him of all hope of obtaining the succour he had gone to
solicit. What can he do then?......The Saxon councillor Von
Planitz, with whom he had quitted Nuremberg, advised him
to see the reformer. "What do you think of the regulations
of my order?" said the restless and agitated prince.
Luther felt no hesitation: he saw that a line of conduct in
conformity with the Gospel was the only thing that could
save Prussia. "Invoke the aid of God," said he to the
grand-master; "throw off the senseless and confused rules
of your order; put an end to that abominable principality,
a veritable hermaphrodite, which is neither religious nor
secular;<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> relinquish that false chastity, and seek the true
one; take a wife, and instead of that nameless monster,
found a legitimate sovereignty."<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> These words placed distinctly
before the mind of the grand-master a state of things
that he had as yet conceived but vaguely. A smile lit up
his features; but he had too much prudence to declare himself;
he remained silent.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Melancthon, who was present,
spoke to the same effect as Luther, and the prince returned
to his states, leaving the reformers under the conviction
that the seed they had sown in his heart would one day
bear fruit.</p>

<p>Thus Charles V. and the pope had opposed the national
assembly at Spires for fear the Word of God should gain
over all who might be present; but the Word of God cannot
be bound; they refused to let it be heard in one of the
halls of a town in the Lower Palatinate; it avenged itself
by spreading over all the provinces; it stirred the hearts
of the people, enlightened the princes, and manifested in
every part of the empire that Divine power which neither
bulls nor edicts can ever take away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PUBLIC WORSHIP REFORMED.</div>

<p>While the nations and their rulers were thus hastening
forward to the light, the reformers were endeavouring to
regenerate everything, to interpenetrate everything with the
principles of Christianity. The state of public worship first
engaged their attention. The time fixed by the reformer, on
his return from the Wartburg, had arrived. "Now," said
he, "that men's hearts have been strengthened by Divine
grace, we must put an end to the scandals that pollute the
kingdom of the Lord, and dare something in the name of
Jesus." He required that men should communicate in both
kinds (the bread and wine); that everything should be retrenched
from the ceremony of the eucharist that tended to
make it a sacrifice;<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> that Christians should never assemble
together without having the Gospel preached;<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> that believers,
or at least the priests and scholars, should meet
every morning at five or six o'clock to read the Old Testament;
and at a corresponding hour in the evening to read
the New Testament; that every Sunday, the whole Church
should assemble in the morning and afternoon, and that
the great object of their worship should be to sound abroad
the Word of God.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CHURCH OF ALL SAINTS.</div>

<p>The church of All Saints at Wittemberg especially excited
Luther's indignation. Seckendorf informs us that 9901
masses were there celebrated yearly, and 35,570 pounds of wax
annually burnt. Luther called it "a sacrilegious Tophet."
"There are only three or four lazy-bellies," said he, "who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
still worship this shameful mammon, and if I had not
restrained the people, this house of All Saints, or rather of
all devils, would have made such a noise in the world as
has never before been heard."</p>

<p>The struggle began around this church. It resembled
those ancient sanctuaries of paganism in Egypt, Gaul, and
Germany, which were destined to fall that Christianity might
be established.</p>

<p>Luther, desiring that the mass should be abolished in this
cathedral, addressed a petition to the chapter to this effect
on the 1st of March 1523, and a second on the 11th of July.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
The canons having pleaded the elector's orders, Luther replied,
"What is the prince's order to us in this case? He
is a secular prince; the sword, and not the preaching of the
Gospel, belongs to him."<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Here Luther clearly marks the
distinction between the State and the Church. "There is
but one sacrifice that taketh away sins," said he again,
"Christ, who offered himself up once for all; and in this we
are partakers, not by works or by sacrifices, but solely by
faith in the Word of God."</p>

<p>The elector, who felt his end drawing near, was opposed
to new reforms.</p>

<p>But fresh entreaties were added to those of Luther. "It
is time to act," said Jonas, provost of the cathedral, to the
elector. "A manifestation of the Gospel, so striking as that
which we now have, does not ordinarily last longer than a
sunbeam. Let us make haste then."<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ABOLITION OF THE MASS.</div>

<p>As the letter of Jonas did not change the elector's views,
Luther lost all patience; he thought the moment had come for
striking a decisive blow, and addressed a threatening letter
to the chapter: "I entreat you amicably, and urge you seriously,
to put an end to all this sectarian worship. If you
refuse, you will receive (with God's help) the reward that
you have deserved. I mention this for your guidance, and
require a positive and immediate answer,&mdash;yes or no,&mdash;before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Sunday next, that I may know what I have to do.
May God give you grace to follow his light.</p>

<p>
"Thursday, 8th December 1524.</p>
<p class="signature">"<span class="smcap">Martin Luther</span>,<br />
"<i>Preacher at Wittemberg</i>."<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a><br />
</p>

<p>At the same time the rector, two burgomasters, and ten
councillors, waited on the dean, and entreated him in the
name of the university, the council, and the township of Wittemberg,
"to abolish the great and horrible impiety committed
in the mass against the majesty of God."</p>

<p>The chapter was forced to give way; they declared that,
being enlightened by the holy Word of God,<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> they acknowledged
the abuses that had been pointed out, and published
a new order of church-service, which began to be observed
on Christmas-day 1524.</p>

<p>Thus fell the mass in this renowned sanctuary, where it
had so long resisted the reiterated attacks of the reformers.
The Elector Frederick, suffering from the gout, and rapidly
drawing near his end, could not, in spite of all his exertions,
prevent this great victory of the Reformation. He saw in it
a manifestation of the Divine will, and gave way. The fall
of the Romish observances in the church of All Saints hastened
their abolition in a great number of churches throughout
Christendom; everywhere the same resistance was offered,&mdash;everywhere
there was the same triumph. In vain did the
priests, and even the princes in many places, try to interpose
obstacles; they could not succeed.</p>

<p>It was not the public worship alone that the Reformation
was ordained to change. The school was early placed beside
the Church; and these two great institutions, so powerful to
regenerate the nations, were equally reanimated by it. It
was by a close alliance with learning that the Reformation
entered into the world; in the hour of its triumph, it did not
forget its ally.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER ON CHRISTIAN EDUCATION.</div>

<p>Christianity is not a simple development of Judaism. Unlike
the papacy, it does not aim at confining man again in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the close swaddling bands of outward ordinances and human
doctrines. Christianity is a new creation; it lays hold of
the inner man, and transforms him in the inmost principles
of his human nature, so that man no longer requires other
men to impose rules upon him; but, aided by God, he can of
himself and by himself distinguish what is true, and do what
is right.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>To lead mankind to that ripe age which Christ has purchased
for them, and to free them from that tutelage in which
Rome had held them so long, the Reformation had to develop
the whole man; and while regenerating his heart and
his will by the Word of God, to enlighten his understanding
by the study of profane and sacred learning.</p>

<p>Luther saw this; he felt that, to strengthen the Reformation,
it was requisite to work on the young, to improve
the schools, and to propagate throughout Christendom the
knowledge necessary for a profound study of the Holy Scriptures.
This, accordingly, was one of the objects of his life.
He saw it in particular at the period which we have reached,
and wrote to the councillors of all the cities of Germany, calling
upon them to found christian schools. "Dear sirs," said
he, "we annually expend so much money on arquebuses,
roads, and dikes, why should we not spend a little to give
one or two schoolmasters to our poor children? God stands
at the door and knocks; blessed are we if we open to him!
Now the Word of God abounds. O my dear Germans, buy,
buy, while the market is open before your houses. The
Word of God and his grace are like a shower that falls and
passes away. It was among the Jews; but it passed away,
and now they have it no longer. Paul carried it into Greece;
but in that country also it has passed away, and the Turk
reigns there now. It came to Rome and the Latin empire;
but there also it has passed away, and Rome now has the
pope.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> O Germans, do not expect to have this Word for ever.
The contempt that is shown to it will drive it away. For this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
reason, let him who desires to possess it lay hold of it and
keep it!</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRUE WEALTH OF A STATE&mdash;LANGUAGES.</div>

<p>"Busy yourselves with the children," continues Luther,
still addressing the magistrates; "for many parents are
like ostriches; they are hardened towards their little ones,
and, satisfied with having laid the egg, they care nothing for
it afterwards. The prosperity of a city does not consist
merely in heaping up great treasures, in building strong
walls, in erecting splendid mansions, in possessing glittering
arms. If madmen fall upon it, its ruin will only be the
greater. The true wealth of a city, its safety, and its strength,
is to have many learned, serious, worthy, well educated
citizens. And whom must we blame, because there are so
few at present, except you magistrates, who have allowed
our youth to grow up like trees in a forest?"</p>

<p>Luther particularly insisted on the necessity of studying
literature and languages: "What use is there, it may be
asked, in learning Latin, Greek, and Hebrew? We can read
the Bible very well in German. Without languages," replies
he, "we could not have received the Gospel......Languages
are the scabbard that contains the sword of the Spirit;<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
they are the casket that guards the jewels; they are the
vessel that holds the wine; and, as the Gospel says, they
are the baskets in which the loaves and fishes are kept to
feed the multitude. If we neglect the languages, we shall
not only eventually lose the Gospel, but be unable to speak
or write in Latin or in German. No sooner did men cease
to cultivate them than Christendom declined, even until it
fell under the power of the pope. But now that languages
are again honoured, they shed such light that all the world
is astonished, and every one is forced to acknowledge that
our Gospel is almost as pure as that of the apostles themselves.
In former times the holy Fathers were frequently
mistaken, because they were ignorant of languages; and in
our days there are some who, like the Waldenses, do not
think the languages to be of any use; but although their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
doctrine be good, they have often erred in the real meaning
of the sacred text; they are without arms against error, and
I fear very much that their faith will not remain pure.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
If the languages had not made me positive as to the
meaning of the Word, I might have been a pious monk, and
quietly preached the truth in the obscurity of a cloister; but
I should have left the pope, the sophists, and their anti-christian
empire still unshaken."<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LEARNING EXTENDED TO THE LAITY.</div>

<p>Luther did not concern himself about the education of the
clergy only; it was his desire that knowledge should not be
confined to the Church; he proposed extending it to the laity,
who hitherto had been deprived of it. He called for the
establishment of libraries, which should comprise not only
editions and commentaries of the schoolmen and of the fathers
of the Church, but also the works of orators and poets, even
were they heathens, as well as writings devoted to the fine
arts, law, medicine, and history. "These productions," said
he, "serve to make known the works and the wonders of
God."</p>

<p>This effort on the part of Luther is one of the most important
produced by the Reformation. He emancipated
learning from the hands of the priests, who had monopolized
it like those of Egypt in times of old, and put it within the
reach of all. From this impulse given by the Reformation
have proceeded the greatest developments of modern times.
Those laymen, whether men of letters or scholars, who now
revile the Reformation, forget that they themselves are its
offspring, and that, without it, they would still be, like
ignorant children, under the rod of the clergy. The Reformation
perceived the close tie that connected all the sciences;
it saw that, as all knowledge is derived from God, it leads
man back to God. It desired that all men should learn,
and that they should learn everything. "Those who despise
profane literature," said Melancthon, "hold theology
in no greater estimation. Their contempt is a mere pretext,
with which they seek to conceal their idleness."<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">PROTESTANTISM AND THE ARTS.</div>

<p>The Reformation was not satisfied with merely giving a
strong impulse to letters; it gave also a fresh impulse to the
arts. Protestantism has often been reproached as their
enemy, and many Protestants willingly accept this reproach.
We will not inquire whether the Reformation ought to glory
in it or not; we shall be content to observe that impartial
history does not confirm the fact on which this accusation is
founded. Let Roman-catholicism pride itself in being more
favourable to the arts than Protestantism; be it so: paganism
was still more favourable, and Protestantism places its glory
elsewhere. There are some religions in which the esthetic
tendencies of man hold a more important place than his moral
nature. Christianity is distinct from these religions, inasmuch
as the moral element is its essence. The christian
sentiment is manifested not by the productions of the fine
arts, but by the works of a christian life. Every sect that
should abandon this moral tendency of Christianity, would
by that very circumstance forfeit its claims to the name of
christian. Rome has not entirely abandoned it, but Protestantism
cherishes this essential characteristic with much
greater purity. It places its glory in diving into all that
concerns the moral being, in judging of religious actions,
not by their external beauty and the manner in which they
strike the imagination, but according to their internal worth,
and the connexion they have with the conscience; so that
if the papacy is above all an esthetical religion, as a celebrated
writer has proved it to be,<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Protestantism is above all
a moral religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MUSIC AND POETRY.</div>

<p>And yet, although the Reformation at first addressed man
as a moral being, it addressed the whole man. We have
just seen how it spoke to his understanding and what it did
for literature; it also spoke to his sensibility, to his imagination,
and contributed to the development of the arts. The
Church was no longer composed exclusively of monks and
priests; it was the assembly of the faithful. All were to
take part in its public worship; and the chanting of the
clergy was to be succeeded by the singing of the people.
Accordingly Luther, in translating the Psalms, thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
adapting them to congregational singing. Thus a taste for
music was spread among the nation.</p>

<p>"Next to theology," said Luther, "I give the first place
and the highest honour to music.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> A schoolmaster should
know how to sing," said he at another time, "or else I will
not so much as look at him."</p>

<p>One day, as certain of his friends were singing some beautiful
chants at his house, he exclaimed with enthusiasm:
"If our Lord God has scattered such admirable gifts on this
earth, which is but a dark corner, what will it not be in the
life eternal, in which all will be perfection!"......Since
Luther's time, the people have sung; the Bible inspired their
songs, and the impulse given at the epoch of the Reformation
produced in later years those noble oratorios which seem
to be the summit of this art.</p>

<p>Poetry shared in the general movement. In singing the
praises of God, men could not confine themselves to mere
translations of the ancient hymns. The souls of Luther and
many of his contemporaries, elevated by faith to the sublimest
ideas, excited to enthusiasm by the conflicts and dangers
that continually threatened the infant Church, inspired by the
poetic genius of the Old Testament, and by the faith of the
New, soon poured forth their feelings in religious songs, in
which poetry and music united and blended their most
heavenly features. Thus in the sixteenth century the hymns
were revived which in the first century had consoled the
pangs of the martyrs. In 1523, Luther, as we have already
seen, consecrated them to the memory of the Brussels martyrs;
other children of the Reformation imitated his example;
these hymns increased in number, and were circulated rapidly
among the people, and contributed powerfully to awaken
them from their slumbers. It was in this same year that
Hans Sachs composed <i>The Nightingale of Wittemberg</i>. The
doctrine that for the last four centuries had prevailed in the
Church was as the moonlight, during which men lost their
way in the wilderness. Now the nightingale proclaims the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
dawn, and, soaring above the mists of the morning, celebrates
the brightness of the coming day.</p>

<p>Whilst lyric poetry thus owed its birth to the loftiest inspirations
of the Reformation, satirical verses and dramas
from the pen of Hütten and Manuel attacked the most crying
abuses.</p>

<p>It is to the Reformation that the greatest poets of England,
Germany, and perhaps of France, are indebted for their
highest flights.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PAINTING.</div>

<p>Of all the arts, painting is that on which the Reformation
had the least influence. Nevertheless, it was renovated, and
as it were sanctified, by the universal movement which at
that time agitated all the powers of man. Lucas Cranach,
the great master of that age, settled at Wittemberg, lived
on intimate terms with Luther, and became the painter of
the Reformation. We have seen how he represented the
contrast between Christ and Antichrist (the pope),<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> and thus
ranked among the most influential organs of the revolution
that was transforming the nations. As soon as he had
received new convictions, he consecrated his chaste pencil
solely to paintings in harmony with christian sentiments,
and spread over groups of children, blessed by our Saviour,
those graces with which he had previously adorned legendary
saints. Albert Durer also was gained over by the Word of
the Gospel, and his genius received a fresh impulse. His
masterpieces date from this period. We see from the touches
with which he henceforward depicted the evangelists and
apostles, that the Bible was restored to the people, and that
the painter thence derived a depth, power, life, and sublimity,
that he would never have found in himself.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>And yet we must confess that of all the arts painting is
that whose religious influence is most exposed to well-founded
and strong objections. Poetry and music come
from heaven, and will be found again in heaven; but we
continually see painting connected with serious immoralities
or mournful errors. After a man has studied history or
visited Italy, he expects nothing beneficial to humanity from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
this art. Whatever may be the value of this exception
which we think it our duty to make, our general remark
still holds good.</p>

<p>The Reformation of Germany, while it primarily addressed
man's moral nature, gave an impulse to the arts that they
had not yet received from Roman-catholicism.</p>

<p>Thus everything advanced: arts, literature, spirituality of
worship, and the minds of princes and of people. But this
noble harmony which the Gospel at its revival everywhere
called forth, was about to be disturbed. The songs of the
Wittemberg nightingale were to be interrupted by the
howling of the tempest and the roaring of lions. In a
moment a cloud overspread all Germany, and a glorious
day was followed by the deepest darkness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POLITICAL FERMENTATION.</div>

<p>A political ferment, very different from that produced by
the Gospel, had long been at work in the empire. The
people, bowed down by civil and ecclesiastical oppression,
bound in many countries to the seigneurial estates, and
transferred from hand to hand along with them, threatened
to rise with fury and at last to break their chains. This
agitation had shown itself long before the Reformation by
many symptoms, and even then the religious element was
blended with the political; in the sixteenth century it was
impossible to separate these two principles, so closely associated
in the existence of nations. In Holland, at the close
of the preceding century, the peasants had revolted, placing
on their banners, by way of arms, a loaf and a cheese, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
two great blessings of these poor people. "The Alliance of
the Shoes" had shown itself in the neighbourhood of Spires
in 1502.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> In 1513, it appeared again in Brisgau, being
encouraged by the priests. In 1514, Wurtemberg had seen
the "League of Poor Conrad," whose aim was to maintain
by rebellion "the right of God." In 1515, Carinthia and
Hungary had been the theatre of terrible agitations. These
seditions had been quenched in torrents of blood; but no relief
had been accorded to the people. A political reform,
therefore, was not less necessary than a religious reform.
The people were entitled to this; but we must acknowledge
that they were not ripe for its enjoyment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER AGAINST INSURRECTION.</div>

<p>Since the commencement of the Reformation, these popular
disturbances had not been renewed; men's minds were occupied
by other thoughts. Luther, whose piercing glance had
discerned the condition of the people, had already from the
summit of the Wartburg addressed them in serious exhortations
calculated to restrain their agitated minds:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rebellion," he had said, "never produces the amelioration
we desire, and God condemns it. What is it to rebel,
if it be not to avenge oneself? The devil is striving to
excite to revolt those who embrace the Gospel, in order to
cover it with opprobrium; but those who have rightly
understood my doctrine do not revolt."<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>Everything gave cause to fear that the popular agitation
could not be restrained much longer. The government that
Frederick of Saxony had taken such pains to form, and
which possessed the confidence of the nation, was dissolved.
The emperor, whose energy might have been an efficient
substitute for the influence of this national administration,
was absent; the princes whose union had always constituted
the strength of Germany were divided; and the new declarations
of Charles V. against Luther, by removing every hope
of future harmony, deprived the reformer of part of the moral
influence by which in 1522 he had succeeded in calming the
storm. The chief barriers that hitherto had confined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
torrent being broken, nothing could any longer restrain its
fury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REFORMATION AND INSURRECTION.</div>

<p>It was not the religious movement that gave birth to political
agitations; but in many places it was carried away
by their impetuous waves. Perhaps we should even go
further, and acknowledge that the movement communicated
to the people by the Reformation gave fresh strength to
the discontent fermenting in the nation. The violence of
Luther's writings, the intrepidity of his actions and language,
the harsh truths that he spoke, not only to the pope
and prelates, but also to the princes themselves, must all
have contributed to inflame minds that were already in a
state of excitement. Accordingly, Erasmus did not fail to
tell him: "We are now reaping the fruits that you have
sown."<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> And further, the cheering truths of the Gospel, at
last brought to light, stirred all hearts, and filled them with
anticipation and hope. But many unregenerated souls were
not prepared by repentance for the faith and liberty of Christians.
They were very willing to throw off the papal yoke,
but they would not take up the yoke of Christ. And hence,
when princes devoted to the cause of Rome endeavoured
in their wrath to stifle the Reformation, real Christians
patiently endured these cruel persecutions; but the multitude
resisted and broke out, and seeing their desires checked
in one direction, gave vent to them in another. "Why,"
said they, "should slavery be perpetuated in the state, while
the Church invites all men to a glorious liberty? Why
should governments rule only by force, when the Gospel
preaches nothing but gentleness?" Unhappily at a time
when the religious reform was received with equal joy both
by princes and people, the political reform, on the contrary,
had the most powerful part of the nation against it; and
while the former had the Gospel for its rule and support, the
latter had soon no other principles than violence and despotism.
Accordingly, while the one was confined within the
bounds of truth, the other rapidly, like an impetuous torrent,
overstepped all limits of justice. But to shut one's eyes against
the indirect influence of the Reformation on the troubles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
that broke out in the empire, would betoken partiality. A
fire had been kindled in Germany by religious discussions,
from which it was impossible to prevent a few sparks escaping
which were calculated to inflame the passions of the
people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MYSTICISM AND THE REFORMATION&mdash;MUNZER.</div>

<p>The claims of a few fanatics to Divine inspiration increased
the evil. While the Reformation had continually appealed
from the pretended authority of the Church to the real
authority of the Holy Scriptures, these enthusiasts not only
rejected the authority of the Church, but of Scripture also;
they spoke only of an inner Word, of an internal revelation
from God; and overlooking the natural corruption of their
hearts, they gave way to all the intoxication of spiritual
pride, and fancied they were saints.</p>

<p>"To them the Holy Scriptures were but a dead letter,"
said Luther, "and they all began to cry, <i>The Spirit! the
Spirit!</i> But most assuredly I will not follow where their
spirit leads them. May God of his mercy preserve me from
a Church in which there are none but saints.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> I desire to
dwell with the humble, the feeble, the sick, who know and
feel their sins, and who groan and cry continually to God
from the bottom of their hearts to obtain his consolation
and support." These words of Luther's have great depth
of meaning, and point out the change that was taking place
in his views as to the nature of the Church. They indicate
at the same time how contrary were the religious opinions of
the rebels to those of the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MUNZER'S PRETENSIONS.</div>

<p>The most notorious of these enthusiasts was Thomas
Munzer; he was not devoid of talent, had read his Bible,
was zealous, and might have done good, if he had been
able to collect his agitated thoughts and find peace of heart.
But as he did not know himself, and was wanting in true
humility, he was possessed with a desire of reforming the
world, and forgot, as all enthusiasts do, that the reformation
should begin with himself. Some mystical writings that he
had read in his youth had given a false direction to his
mind. He first appeared at Zwickau, quitted Wittemberg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
after Luther's return, dissatisfied with the inferior part he
was playing, and became pastor of the small town of
Alstadt in Thuringia. He could not long remain quiet, and
accused the reformers of founding, by their adherence to the
letter, a new popery, and of forming churches which were
not pure and holy.</p>

<p>"Luther," said he, "has delivered men's consciences from
the yoke of the pope, but he has left them in a carnal liberty,
and not led them in spirit towards God."<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>He considered himself as called of God to remedy this great
evil. The revelations of the <i>Spirit</i> were in his eyes the
means by which his reform was to be effected. "He who
possesses this Spirit," said he, "possesses the true faith,
although he should never see the Scriptures in his life.
Heathens and Turks are better fitted to receive it than many
Christians who style us enthusiasts." It was Luther whom he
here had in view. "To receive this Spirit we must mortify
the flesh," said he at another time, "wear tattered clothing,
let the beard grow, be of a sad countenance, keep silence,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
retire into desert places, and supplicate God to give us a
sign of his favour. Then God will come and speak with
us, as formerly He spoke with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
If He were not to do so, He would not deserve our attention.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
I have received from God the commission to gather
together his elect into a holy and eternal alliance."</p>

<div class="sidenote">AGITATION&mdash;LUTHER'S POSITION</div>

<p>The agitation and ferment which were at work in men's
minds were but too favourable to the dissemination of these
enthusiastic ideas. Man loves the marvellous, and whatever
flatters his pride. Munzer, having persuaded a part of his
flock to adopt his views, abolished ecclesiastical singing
and all other ceremonies. He maintained that obedience to
princes "void of understanding," was at once to serve God
and Belial. Then marching out at the head of his parishioners
to a chapel in the vicinity of Alstadt, whither
pilgrims from all quarters were accustomed to resort, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
pulled it down. After this exploit, being compelled to leave
that neighbourhood, he wandered about Germany, and went
as far as Switzerland, carrying with him, and communicating
to all who would listen to him, the plan of a general
revolution. Everywhere he found men's minds prepared;
he threw gunpowder on the burning coals, and the explosion
forthwith took place.</p>

<p>Luther, who had rejected the warlike enterprises of Sickengen,<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
could not be led away by the tumultuous movements
of the peasantry. Fortunately for social order, the Gospel
preserved him; for what would have happened had he
carried his extensive influence into their camp?......He
ever firmly maintained the distinction between secular and
spiritual things; he continually repeated that it was immortal
souls which Christ emancipated by his Word; and
if, with one hand, he attacked the authority of the Church,
with the other he upheld with equal power the authority of
princes. "A Christian," said he, "should endure a hundred
deaths, rather than meddle in the slightest degree with the
revolt of the peasants." He wrote to the elector: "It
causes me especial joy that these enthusiasts themselves
boast, to all who are willing to listen to them, that they do
not belong to us. The Spirit urges them on, say they; and
I reply, it is an evil spirit, for he bears no other fruit than
the pillage of convents and churches; the greatest highway
robbers upon earth might do as much."</p>

<p>At the same time, Luther, who desired that others should
enjoy the liberty he claimed for himself, dissuaded the prince
from all measures of severity: "Let them preach what they
please, and against whom they please," said he; "for it is
the Word of God that must march in front of the battle and
fight against them. If their spirit be the true Spirit, he will
not fear our severity; if ours is the true one, he will not fear
their violence. Let us leave the spirits to struggle and contend
with one another.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Perhaps some persons may be led
astray; there is no battle without wounds; but he who fighteth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
faithfully shall be crowned. Nevertheless, if they desire
to take up the sword, let your highness forbid it, and order
them to quit the country."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BLACK FOREST&mdash;THE TWELVE ARTICLES.</div>

<p>The insurrection began in the Black Forest, and near the
sources of the Danube, so frequently the theatre of popular
commotions. On the 19th of July 1524, some Thurgovian
peasants rose against the Abbot of Reichenau, who would
not accord them an evangelical preacher. Erelong thousands
were collected round the small town of Tengen, to liberate an
ecclesiastic who was there imprisoned. The revolt spread
with inconceivable rapidity from Swabia as far as the Rhenish
provinces, Franconia, Thuringia, and Saxony. In
the month of January 1525, all these countries were in a
state of rebellion.</p>

<p>About the end of this month, the peasants published a
declaration in twelve articles, in which they claimed the
liberty of choosing their own pastors, the abolition of small
tithes, of slavery, and of fines on inheritance, the right to
hunt, fish, and cut wood, &amp;c. Each demand was backed by
a passage from Holy Writ, and they said in conclusion, "If
we are deceived, let Luther correct us by Scripture."</p>

<p>The opinions of the Wittemberg divines were consulted.
Luther and Melancthon delivered theirs separately, and they
both gave evidence of the difference of their characters.
Melancthon, who thought every kind of disturbance a crime,
oversteps the limits of his usual gentleness, and cannot find
language strong enough to express his indignation. The
peasants are criminals, against whom he invokes all laws
human and Divine. If friendly negotiation is unavailing, the
magistrates should hunt them down, as if they were robbers
and assassins. "And yet," adds he (and we require at least
one feature to remind us of Melancthon), "let them take
pity on the orphans when having recourse to the penalty of
death!"</p>

<p>Luther's opinion of the revolt was the same as Melancthon's;
but he had a heart that beat for the miseries of the
people. On this occasion he manifested a dignified impartiality,
and spoke the truth frankly to both parties. He first
addressed the princes, and more especially the bishops:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S OPINION.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>"It is you," said he, "who are the cause of this revolt; it
is your clamours against the Gospel, your guilty oppressions
of the poor, that have driven the people to despair. It is not
the peasants, my dear Lords, that rise up against you,&mdash;it is
God himself who opposes your madness.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> The peasants are
but the instruments he employs to humble you. Do not
imagine you can escape the punishment he is preparing for
you. Even should you have succeeded in destroying all
these peasants, God is able from the very stones to raise up
others to chastise your pride. If I desired revenge, I might
laugh in my sleeve, and look on while the peasants were
carrying on their work, or even increase their fury; but may
God preserve me from such thoughts!......My dear Lords,
put away your indignation, treat these poor peasants as a
man of sense treats people who are drunk or insane. Quiet
these commotions by mildness, lest a conflagration should
arise and burn all Germany. Among these twelve articles
there are certain demands which are just and equitable."</p>

<p>This prologue was calculated to conciliate the peasants'
confidence in Luther, and to make them listen patiently to
the truths he had to tell them. He represented to them that
the greater number of their demands were well founded; but
that to revolt was to act like heathens; that the duty of a
Christian is to be patient, not to fight; that if they persisted
in revolting against the Gospel in the name of the Gospel,
he should look upon them as more dangerous enemies than
the pope. "The pope and the emperor," continued he, "combined
against me; but the more they blustered the more did
the Gospel gain ground......And why was this? Because
I have never drawn the sword or called for vengeance; because
I never had recourse to tumult or insurrection: I relied
wholly upon God, and placed everything in His almighty
hands. Christians fight not with swords or arquebuses, but
with sufferings and with the cross. Christ, their Captain,
handled not the sword......he was hung upon a tree."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HELFENSTEIN&mdash;LUTHER'S INDIGNATION.</div>

<p>But to no purpose did Luther employ this christian language.
The people were too much excited by the fanatical
speeches of the leaders of the insurrection, to listen, as of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
old, to the words of the reformer. "He is playing the
hypocrite," said they; "he flatters the nobles. He has
declared war against the pope, and yet wishes us to submit
to our oppressors."</p>

<p>The revolt, instead of dying away, became more formidable.
At Weinsberg, Count Louis of Helfenstein and the seventy
men under his orders were condemned to death by the rebels.
A body of peasants drew up with their pikes lowered, whilst
others drove the count and his soldiers against this wall of
steel.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> The wife of the wretched Helfenstein, a natural daughter
of the Emperor Maximilian, holding an infant two years
old in her arms, knelt before them, and with loud cries begged
for her husband's life, and vainly endeavoured to arrest this
march of murder; a boy who had been in the count's service,
and had joined the rebels, capered gaily before him, and
played the dead march upon his fife, as if he had been leading
his victims in a dance. All perished; the child was
wounded in its mother's arms; and she herself thrown upon
a dung-cart, and thus conveyed to Heilbrunn.</p>

<p>At the news of these cruelties, a cry of horror was heard
from the friends of the Reformation, and Luther's feeling
heart underwent a terrible conflict. On the one hand the
peasants, ridiculing his advice, pretended to receive revelations
from heaven, made an impious use of the threatenings
of the Old Testament, proclaimed an equality of ranks and a
community of goods, defended their cause with fire and
sword, and indulged in barbarous atrocities. On the other
hand, the enemies of the Reformation asked the reformer,
with a malicious sneer, if he did not know that it was easier
to kindle a fire than to extinguish it. Shocked at these
excesses, alarmed at the thought that they might check the
progress of the Gospel, Luther hesitated no longer, no longer
temporized; he inveighed against the insurgents with all
the energy of his character, and perhaps overstepped
the just bounds within which he should have contained
himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S INDIGNATION&mdash;MARCH OF THE PEASANTS.</div>

<p>"The peasants," said he, "commit three horrible sins
against God and man, and thus deserve the death of body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and soul. First, they revolt against their magistrates to
whom they have sworn fidelity; next, they rob and plunder
convents and castles; and lastly, they veil their crimes with
the cloak of the Gospel. If you do not put a mad dog to
death, you will perish, and all the country with you. Whoever
is killed fighting for the magistrates will be a true
martyr, if he has fought with, a good conscience." Luther
then gives a powerful description of the guilty violence of the
peasants who force simple and peaceable men to join their
alliance, and thus drag them to the same condemnation.
He then adds: "For this reason, my dear Lords, help, save,
deliver, have pity on these poor people. Let every one
strike, pierce, and kill, who is able......If thou diest, thou
canst not meet a happier death; for thou diest in the service
of God, and to save thy neighbour from hell."<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>Neither gentleness nor violence could arrest the popular
torrent. The church-bells were no longer rung for divine
service; whenever their deep and prolonged sounds were
heard in the fields, it was the tocsin, and all ran to arms.
The people of the Black Forest had rallied round John Muller
of Bulgenbach. With an imposing aspect, covered with a red
cloak, and wearing a red cap, this leader boldly advanced
from village to village followed by the peasantry. Behind
him, on a waggon decorated with ribands and branches of
trees, was raised the tricolor flag, black, red, and white,&mdash;the
signal of revolt. A herald, dressed in the same colours,
read the twelve articles, and invited the people to join in the
rebellion. Whoever refused was banished from the community.</p>

<p>Erelong this march, which at first was peaceable, became
more disquieting. "We must compel the lords to submit
to our alliance," exclaimed they. And to induce them to do
so, they plundered the granaries, emptied the cellars, drew the
seigneurial fish-ponds, demolished the castles of the nobles
who resisted, and burnt the convents. Opposition had inflamed
the passions of those rude men; equality no longer
satisfied them; they thirsted for blood, and swore to put to
death every man who wore a spur.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VIOLENCE&mdash;THE NOBLES&mdash;THE REVOLT SPREADS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>At the approach of the peasants, the cities that were
unable to resist them opened their gates and joined them.
In whatever place they entered, they pulled down the
images and broke the crucifixes; armed women paraded
the streets and threatened the monks. If they were defeated
in one quarter, they assembled again in another, and braved
the most formidable forces. A committee of peasants was
established at Heilbrunn. The Counts of Lowenstein were
taken prisoners, dressed in a smock-frock, and then, a white
staff having been placed in their hands, they were compelled
to swear to the twelve articles. "Brother George, and thou,
brother Albert," said a tinker of Ohringen to the Counts of
Hohenlohe, who had gone to their camp, "swear to conduct
yourselves as our brethren; for you also are now peasants;
you are no longer lords." Equality of rank, the dream of
many democrats, was established in aristocratic Germany.</p>

<p>Many nobles, some through fear, others from ambition,
then joined the insurgents. The famous Goetz von Berlichingen,
finding his vassals refuse to obey him, desired to
flee to the Elector of Saxony; but his wife, who was lying-in,
wishing to keep him near her, concealed the elector's answer.
Goetz, being closely pursued, was compelled to put himself
at the head of the rebel army. On the 7th of May the
peasants entered Wurtzburg, where the citizens received them
with acclamations. The forces of the princes and knights of
Swabia and Franconia, which had assembled in this city,
evacuated it, and retired in confusion to the citadel, the last
bulwark of the nobility.</p>

<p>But the movement had already extended to other parts of
Germany. Spires, the Palatinate, Alsace, and Hesse accepted
the twelve articles, and the peasants threatened Bavaria,
Westphalia, the Tyrol, Saxony, and Lorraine. The
Margrave of Baden, having rejected the articles, was compelled
to flee. The coadjutor of Fulda acceded to them with
a smile. The smaller towns said, they had no lances with
which to oppose the insurgents. Mentz, Treves, and Frankfort
obtained the liberties which they had claimed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARCH OF THE IMPERIAL ARMY.</div>

<p>An immense revolution was preparing in all the empire.
The ecclesiastical and secular privileges, that bore so heavily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
on the peasants, were to be suppressed; the possessions of
the clergy were to be secularized, to indemnify the princes
and provide for the wants of the empire; taxes were to be
abolished, with the exception of a tribute payable every ten
years; the imperial power was to subsist alone, as being
recognised by the New Testament; all the other princes were
to cease to reign; sixty-four free tribunals were to be established,
in which men of all classes should have a seat; all
ranks were to return to their primitive condition; the clergy
were to be henceforward merely the pastors of the churches;
princes and knights were to be simply the defenders of the
weak; uniformity in weights and measures was to be introduced,
and only one kind of money was to be coined throughout
the empire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the princes had shaken off their first lethargy,
and George von Truchsess, commander-in-chief of the imperial
army, was advancing on the side of the Lake of
Constance. On the 2d of May he defeated the peasants at
Beblingen, marched on the town of Weinsberg, where the
unhappy Count of Helfenstein had perished, burnt and razed
it to the ground, giving orders that the ruins should be left
as an eternal monument of the treason of its inhabitants.
At Fürfeld he united with the Elector Palatine and the
Elector of Treves, and all three moved towards Franconia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEFEAT OF THE PEASANTS.</div>

<p>The Frauenburg, the citadel of Wurtzburg, held out for
the princes, and the main army of the peasants still lay before
its walls. As soon as they heard of Truchsess' march,
they resolved on an assault, and at nine o'clock at night on
the 15th of May, the trumpets sounded, the tricolor flag
was unfurled, and the peasants rushed to the attack with
horrible shouts. Sebastian von Rotenhan, one of the warmest
partisans of the Reformation, was governor of the castle.
He had put the fortress in a formidable state of defence, and
having exhorted the garrison to repel the assault with courage,
the soldiers, holding up three fingers, had all sworn to do so.
A most terrible conflict then took place. To the vigour and
despair of the insurgents the fortress replied from its walls
and towers by petards, showers of sulphur and boiling pitch,
and the discharges of artillery. The peasants, thus struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
by their unseen enemies, were staggered for a moment; but
in an instant their fury grew more violent. The struggle
was prolonged as the night advanced. The fortress, lit up
by a thousand battle-fires, appeared in the darkness like a
towering giant, who, vomiting flames, struggled alone amidst
the roar of thunder for the salvation of the empire against
the ferocious valour of these furious hordes. Two hours
after midnight the peasants withdrew, having failed in all
their efforts.</p>

<p>They now tried to enter into negotiations, either with the
garrison or with Truchsess, who was advancing at the head
of his army. But this was going out of their path; violence
and victory alone could save them. After some little hesitation,
they resolved to march against the imperial forces,
but the cavalry and artillery made terrible havoc in their
ranks. At Königshofen, and afterwards at Engelstadt, those
unfortunate creatures were totally defeated. The princes,
nobles, and bishops, abusing their victory, indulged in the
most unprecedented cruelties. The prisoners were hung on
the trees by the wayside. The Bishop of Wurtzburg, who
had run away, now returned, traversed his diocese accompanied
by executioners, and watered it alike with the blood
of the rebels and of the peaceful friends of the Word of God.
Goetz von Berlichingen was sentenced to imprisonment for
life. The Margrave Casimir of Anspach put out the eyes of
eighty-five insurgents, who had sworn that their eyes should
never look upon that prince again; and he cast this troop of
blinded individuals upon the world, who wandered up and
down, holding each other by the hand, groping along, tottering,
and begging their bread. The wretched boy, who had played
the dead-march on his fife at the murder of Helfenstein, was
chained to a post; a fire was kindled around him, and the
knights looked on laughing at his horrible contortions.</p>

<p>Public worship was everywhere restored in its ancient forms.
The most flourishing and populous districts of the empire
exhibited to those who travelled through them nothing but
heaps of dead bodies and smoking ruins. Fifty thousand
men had perished, and the people lost nearly everywhere the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
little liberty they had hitherto enjoyed. Such was the horrible
termination of this revolt in the south of Germany.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Munzer at Mulhausen&mdash;Appeal to the People&mdash;March of the Princes&mdash;End
of the Revolt&mdash;Influence of the Reformers&mdash;Sufferings&mdash;Changes&mdash;Two
Results.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">MUNZER AT MULHAUSEN.</div>

<p>But the evil was not confined to the south and west of Germany.
Munzer, after having traversed a part of Switzerland,
Alsace, and Swabia, had again directed his steps towards
Saxony. A few citizens of Mulhausen, in Thuringia, had
invited him to their city, and elected him their pastor. The
town-council having resisted, Munzer deposed it and nominated
another, consisting of his friends, with himself at
their head. Full of contempt for that Christ, "sweet as
honey," whom Luther preached, and being resolved to employ
the most energetic measures, he exclaimed: "Like Joshua,
we must put all the Canaanites to the sword." He established
a community of goods, and pillaged the convents.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>
"Munzer," wrote Luther to Amsdorff on the 11th of April
1525, "Munzer is not only pastor, but king and emperor of
Mulhausen." The poor no longer worked; if any one needed
corn or cloth, he went and demanded it of some rich man;
if the latter refused, the poor man took it by force; if he resisted,
he was hung. As Mulhausen was an independent
city, Munzer was able to exercise his power for nearly a year
without opposition. The revolt in the south of Germany
led him to imagine that it was time to extend his new kingdom.
He had a number of heavy guns cast in the Franciscan
convent, and endeavoured to raise the peasantry and
miners of Mansfeldt. "How long will you sleep?" said he
to them in a fanatical proclamation. "Arise and fight the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
battle of the Lord! The time is come. France, Germany,
and Italy are moving. On, on, on!&mdash;Dran, Dran, Dran!.....Heed
not the groans of the impious ones. They will
implore you like children; but be pitiless.&mdash;Dran, Dran,
Dran!......The fire is burning: let your sword be ever warm
with blood.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>&mdash;Dran, Dran, Dran!......Work while it is yet
day." The letter was signed "<span class="smcap">Munzer</span>, servant of God
against the wicked."</p>

<div class="sidenote">APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE&mdash;TERROR.</div>

<p>The country people, thirsting for plunder, flocked round
his standard. Throughout all the districts of Mansfeldt,
Stolberg, and Schwartzburg in Hesse, and the duchy of
Brunswick, the peasantry rose in insurrection. The convents
of Michelstein, Ilsenburg, Walkenried, Rossleben, and
many others in the neighbourhood of the Hartz, or in the plains
of Thuringia, were devastated. At Reinhardsbrunn, which
Luther had visited, the tombs of the ancient landgraves
were profaned, and the library destroyed.</p>

<p>Terror spread far and wide. Even at Wittemberg some
anxiety was felt. Those doctors, who had feared neither the
emperor nor the pope, trembled in the presence of a madman.
They were always on the watch for news, and every step of
the rebels was counted. "We are here in great danger,"
said Melancthon. "If Munzer succeeds, it is all over with
us, unless Christ should rescue us. Munzer advances with
a worse than Scythian cruelty,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> and it is impossible to repeat
his dreadful threats."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ELECTOR&mdash;MARCH OF THE PRINCES.</div>

<p>The pious elector had long hesitated what he should do.
Munzer had exhorted him and all the princes to be converted,
because (said he) their hour was come; and he had
signed these letters: "<span class="smcap">Munzer</span>, armed with the sword of
Gideon." Frederick would have desired to reclaim these
misguided men by gentle measures. On the 14th of April,
when he was dangerously ill, he had written to his brother
John: "We may have given these wretched people more
than one cause for insurrection. Alas! the poor are oppressed
in many ways by their spiritual and temporal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
lords." And when his attention was directed to the humiliation,
the revolutions, the dangers to which he would expose
himself, unless he promptly stifled the rebellion, he replied:
"Hitherto I have been a mighty elector, having chariots and
horses in abundance; if it be God's pleasure to take them
from me now, I will go on foot."<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>The youthful Philip, landgrave of Hesse, was the first of
the princes who took up arms. His knights and soldiers
swore to live and die with him. After pacifying his own
states, he directed his march towards Saxony. On their
side, Duke John, the elector's brother, Duke George of
Saxony, and Duke Henry of Brunswick, advanced and
united their troops with those of Hesse. The peasants,
terrified at the sight of this army, fled to a small hill, where,
without any discipline, without arms, and for the most part
without courage, they formed a rampart with their waggons.
Munzer had not even prepared ammunition for his large
guns. No succours appeared; the rebels were hemmed in
by the army; they lost all confidence. The princes, taking
pity on them, offered them propositions which they appeared
willing to accept. Upon this Munzer had recourse to the
most powerful lever that enthusiasm can put in motion.
"To-day we shall behold the arm of the Lord," said he,
"and all our enemies shall be destroyed." At this moment
a rainbow appeared over their heads; the fanatical host,
who carried a rainbow on their flags, beheld in it a sure
prognostic of the Divine protection. Munzer took advantage
of it: "Fear nothing," said he to the citizens and
peasants; "I will catch all their balls in my sleeve."<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> At
the same time he cruelly put to death a young gentleman,
Maternus von Geholfen, an envoy from the princes, in order
to deprive the insurgents of all hope of pardon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">END OF THE INSURRECTION.</div>

<p>The landgrave, having assembled his horsemen, said to
them: "I well know that we princes are often in fault, for
we are but men; but God commands all men to honour the
powers that be. Let us save our wives and children from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the fury of these murderers. The Lord will give us the
victory, for he has said: <i>Whosoever resisteth the power, resisteth
the ordinance of God</i>." Philip then gave the signal of
attack. It was the 15th of May 1525. The army was put
in motion; but the peasant host stood immovable, singing
the hymn, "Come, Holy Ghost," and waiting for Heaven to
declare in their favour. The artillery soon broke down their
rude rampart, carrying dismay and death into the midst
of the insurgents. Their fanaticism and courage at once
forsook them; they were seized with a panic-terror, and ran
away in disorder. Five thousand perished in the flight.</p>

<p>After the battle the princes and their victorious troops
entered Frankenhausen. A soldier, who had gone into a
loft in the house where he was quartered, found a man in
bed.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> "Who art thou," asked he; "art thou one of the
rebels?" Then observing a pocket-book, he took it up, and
found several letters addressed to Thomas Munzer. "Art
thou Munzer?" demanded the trooper. The sick man
answered "No." But as the soldier uttered dreadful threats,
Munzer, for it was really he, confessed who he was. "Thou
art my prisoner," said the horseman. When Munzer was
taken before Duke George and the landgrave, he persevered
in saying that he was right to chastise the princes, since
they opposed the Gospel. "Wretched man!" replied they,
"think of all those of whose death you have been the
cause." But he answered, smiling in the midst of his
anguish: "They would have it so!" He took the sacrament
under one kind, and was beheaded at the same time
with Pfeiffer, his lieutenant. Mulhausen was taken, and the
peasants were loaded with chains.</p>

<p>A nobleman having observed among the crowd of prisoners
a peasant of favourable appearance, went up and said to
him: "Well, my man, which government do you like best&mdash;that
of the peasants or of the princes?" The poor fellow
made answer with a deep sigh: "Ah, my lord, no knife cuts
so deep as the rule of peasant over his fellows."<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>
<div class="sidenote">INFLUENCE OF THE REFORMERS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>

The relics of the insurrection were quenched in blood;
Duke George, in particular, acted with the greatest severity.
In the states of the elector, there were neither executions
nor punishment.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> The Word of God, preached in all its
purity, had shown its power to restrain the tumultuous
passions of the people.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, indeed, Luther had not ceased
to struggle against the rebellion, which was, in his opinion,
the forerunner of the judgment-day. Advice, prayers, and
even irony had not been spared. At the end of the articles
drawn up at Erfurth by the rebels, he had subjoined, as a
supplementary article: "<i>Item</i>, The following article has been
omitted. Henceforward the honourable council shall have
no power; it shall do nothing; it shall sit like an idol or a
log of wood; the commonalty shall chew its food, and it
shall govern with its hands and feet tied; henceforth the
waggon shall guide the horses, the horses shall hold the
reins, and we shall go on admirably, in conformity with the
glorious system set forth in these articles."</p>

<p>Luther did not confine himself to writing. While the
disturbance was still at its height, he quitted Wittemberg
and went through some of the districts where the agitation
was greatest. He preached, he laboured to soften his hearers'
hearts, and his hand, to which God had given power, turned
aside, quieted, and brought back the impetuous and overflowing
torrents into their natural channels.</p>

<p>In every quarter the doctors of the Reformation exerted a
similar influence. At Halle, Brentz had revived the drooping
spirits of the citizens by the promises of God's Word,
and four thousand peasants had fled before six hundred
citizens.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> At Ichterhausen, a mob of peasants having assembled
with an intent to demolish several castles and put
their lords to death, Frederick Myconius went out to them
alone, and such was the power of his words, that they immediately
abandoned their design.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S SPIRITUAL AGONY.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>Such was the part taken by the reformers and the Reformation
in the midst of this revolt; they contended against it
with all their might, with the sword of the Word, and boldly
maintained those principles which alone, in every age, can
preserve order and subjection among the nations. Accordingly,
Luther asserted that if the power of sound doctrine
had not checked the fury of the people, the revolt would have
extended its ravages far more widely, and have overthrown
both Church and State. Everything leads us to believe that
these melancholy prognostics would have been realized.</p>

<p>If the reformers thus contended against sedition, it was
not without receiving grievous wounds. That moral agony
which Luther had first suffered in his cell at Erfurth, became
still more serious after the insurrection of the peasants.
No great change takes place among men without suffering
on the part of those who are its instruments. The birth of
Christianity was effected by the agony of the cross; but He
who hung upon that cross addressed these words to each
of his disciples: <i>Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall
drink of, and to be baptized with the same baptism that I am
baptized with?</i></p>

<p>On the side of the princes, it was continually repeated
that Luther and his doctrine were the cause of the revolt,
and, however absurd this idea may be, the reformer could
not see it so generally entertained without experiencing the
deepest grief. On the side of the people, Munzer and all
the leaders of the insurrection represented him as a vile
hypocrite, a flatterer of the great,<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> and these calumnies easily
obtained belief. The violence with which Luther had declared
against the rebels had displeased even moderate men.
The friends of Rome exulted;<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> all were against him, and
he bore the heavy anger of his times. But his greatest affliction
was to behold the work of heaven thus dragged in
the mire, and classed with the most fanatical projects. Here
he felt was his Gethsemane: he saw the bitter cup that was
presented to him; and foreboding that he would be forsaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
by all, he exclaimed: "Soon, perhaps, I also shall be able
to say: <i>All ye shall be offended because of me this night</i>."<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CHANGE.</div>

<p>Yet in the midst of this deep bitterness, he preserved his
faith: "He who has given me power to trample the enemy
under foot," said he, "when he rose up against me like a
cruel dragon or a furious lion, will not permit this enemy
to crush me, now that he appears before me with the
treacherous glance of the basilisk.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> I groan as I contemplate
those calamities. Often have I asked myself, whether
it would not have been better to have allowed the papacy
to go on quietly, rather than witness the occurrence of so
many troubles and seditions in the world. But no! it is
better to have snatched a few souls from the jaws of the
devil, than to have left them all between his murderous
fangs."<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>Now terminated the revolution in Luther's mind that had
begun at the period of his return from the Wartburg. The
inner life no longer satisfied him: the Church and her institutions
now became most important in his eyes. The
boldness with which he had thrown down everything was
checked at the sight of still more sweeping destructions; he
felt it his duty to preserve, govern, and build up; and from
the midst of the blood-stained ruins with which the peasant
war had covered all Germany, the edifice of the new Church
began slowly to arise.</p>

<p>These disturbances left a lasting and deep impression on
men's minds. The nations had been struck with dismay.
The masses, who had sought in the Reformation nothing
but political reform, withdrew from it of their own accord,
when they saw it offered them spiritual liberty only.
Luther's opposition to the peasants was his renunciation of
the ephemeral favour of the people. A seeming tranquillity
was soon established, and the noise of enthusiasm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
sedition was followed in all Germany by a silence inspired
by terror.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO RESULTS.</div>

<p>Thus the popular passions, the cause of revolution, the
interests of a radical equality, were quelled in the empire;
but the Reformation did not yield. These two movements,
which many have confounded with each other, were clearly
marked out by the difference of their results. The insurrection
was from below; the Reformation from above. A
few horsemen and cannons were sufficient to put down the
one; but the other never ceased to rise in strength and
vigour, in despite of the reiterated assaults of the empire and
the Church.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Death of the Elector Frederick&mdash;The Prince and the Reformer&mdash;Roman-catholic
Alliance&mdash;Plans of Charles the Fifth&mdash;Dangers.</p></blockquote>


<p>Meanwhile the cause of the Reformation itself appeared as if
it would perish in the gulf that had swallowed up the liberties
of the people. A melancholy event seemed destined to
accelerate its fall. At the moment when the princes were
marching against Munzer, and ten days before his defeat,
the aged Elector of Saxony, that man whom God had raised
up to defend the Reformation against all dangers from without,
descended to the tomb.</p>

<p>His strength diminished day by day; the horrors that
accompanied the peasant war wrung his feeling heart.
"Alas!" exclaimed he with a deep sigh, "if it were God's
will, I should die with joy. I see neither love, nor truth,
nor faith, nor any good remaining upon earth."<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF THE ELECTOR.</div>

<p>Averting his eyes from the struggles then prevailing throughout
Germany, this pious prince, who was at that time residing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
in the castle of Lochau, tranquilly prepared to depart. On the
4th of May he called for his chaplain, the faithful Spalatin:
"You do right to come and see me," said he mildly, as the
chaplain entered: "for it is our duty to visit the sick." Then
ordering his couch to be wheeled towards the table near which
Spalatin was sitting, he bade his attendants leave the room,
and then affectionately taking his friend's hand, spoke with
him familiarly about Luther, the peasants, and his approaching
departure. Spalatin came again at eight in the evening;
the aged prince then unburdened his soul, and confessed
his sins in the presence of God. On the morrow, it was
the 5th of May, he received the communion under both
kinds. No member of his family was near him; his brother
and his nephew were gone with the army; but his domestics
stood around him, according to the ancient custom of those
times. As they gazed on that venerable prince, whom it
had been so sweet a task to serve, they all burst into tears.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>
"My little children," said he tenderly, "if I have offended
any one of you, forgive me for the love of God; for we
princes often give offence to the poor, and that is wrong."
Thus did Frederick obey the injunction of the apostle:
<i>Let him that is rich rejoice in that he is made low; because
as the flower of the grass he shall pass away</i>.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>Spalatin did not leave him again; he set before him the
rich promises of the Gospel, and the pious elector drank in
its powerful consolations with indescribable peace. The
doctrine of the Gospel was no longer to him that sword
which attacks error, following it up wherever it may be
found, and after a vigorous contest triumphing over it at
last; it fell upon his heart like the dew, or the gentle rain,
filling it with hope and joy. Frederick had forgotten the
present world: he saw nothing but God and eternity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PRINCE AND THE REFORMER.</div>

<p>Feeling the rapid approach of death, he destroyed a will
that he had made some years before, and in which he had
commended his soul to "the mother of God;" and dictated
another, in which he called upon the holy and the sole
merits of Jesus Christ "for the forgiveness of his sins,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and declared his firm assurance "that he was redeemed by
the precious blood of his beloved Saviour."<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> He then
added: "I can say no more!" and that evening, at five
o'clock, he quietly fell asleep. "He was a child of peace,"
exclaimed his physician, "and in peace he has departed."&mdash;"O
bitter death to all whom he has left behind him!" said
Luther.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>Luther, who was then travelling through Thuringia to
allay the excitement, had never seen the elector, except at
a distance, at Worms at the side of Charles the Fifth. But
these two men had met in spirit from the very moment the
reformer appeared. Frederick laboured for nationality and
independence, as Luther did for truth and reformation.
Unquestionably the Reformation was above all things a
spiritual work; but it was perhaps necessary for its early
success that it should be linked with some national interest.
Accordingly Luther had no sooner risen up against indulgences
than the alliance between the prince and the monk
was tacitly concluded:&mdash;an alliance that was purely moral,
without contract or writing, or even words, and in which
the strong man lent no aid to the weak, but only allowed
him to act. But now that the vigorous oak was cut down
under whose shelter the Reformation had gradually grown
up,&mdash;now that the enemies of the Gospel were everywhere
manifesting fresh force and hatred, and that its supporters
were compelled to hide themselves or remain silent, nothing
seemed able to defend them any longer against the sword of
those who were pursuing it with such violence.</p>

<p>The confederates of Ratisbon, who had conquered the
peasants in the south and west of the empire, were in all
parts attacking the Reformation and the revolt alike. At
Wurtzburg and at Bamberg they put to death many of the
most peaceable citizens, and even some of those who had
resisted the peasants. "What matters it?" said they
openly; "these people were attached to the Gospel." This
was enough to make their heads fall on the scaffold.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ROMANIST ALLIANCE&mdash;CHARLES'S PLANS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>Duke George hoped to impart his hatred and his affections
to the landgrave and Duke John. "See," said he to
them after the defeat of the peasants, as he pointed to the
field of battle, "see what miseries Luther has occasioned!"
John and Philip appeared to give him hopes that they
would adopt his ideas. "Duke George," said the reformer,
"imagines he shall triumph, now that Frederick is dead;
but Christ reigns in the midst of His enemies: in vain do
they gnash their teeth,......their desire shall perish."<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>George lost no time in forming a confederation in the
north of Germany, similar to that of Ratisbon. The Electors
of Mentz and Brandenburg, Dukes Henry and Erick of
Brunswick, and Duke George, met at Dessau and concluded
a Romish alliance in the month of July.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> George
urged the new elector and his son-in-law the landgrave to
join it. And then, as if to intimate what might be expected
of it, he beheaded two citizens of Leipsic in whose house
some of the reformer's writings had been found.</p>

<p>At the same time letters from Charles V., dated from
Toledo, arrived in Germany, by which another diet was
convoked at Augsburg. Charles wished to give the empire
a constitution that would enable him to dispose of the forces
of Germany at his good pleasure. Religious differences
offered him the means; he had only to let loose the Catholics
against the followers of the Gospel, and when they had exhausted
their strength, he would easily triumph over both.
Down with the Lutherans! was therefore the cry of the
emperor.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DANGERS.</div>

<p>Thus all things combined against the Reformation. Never
had Luther's spirit been overwhelmed by so many fears.
The remnants of Munzer's party had sworn to take his
life; his sole protector was no more; Duke George, he
was informed, intended to have him arrested in Wittemberg
itself;<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> the princes who might have defended him bowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
their heads, and seemed to have forsaken the Gospel; it was
rumoured that the university, the number of whose students
was already diminished by these troubles, was about to be
suppressed by the new elector; and Charles, victorious at
Pavia, was assembling a new diet with the end of giving a
deathblow to the Reformation. What dangers must not
Luther have foreboded!......This anguish, these inward
struggles, that had so often tortured him to groans, now
wrung his soul. How can he resist so many enemies? In
the midst of these agitations, in the face of so many dangers,
beside the corpse of Frederick that was scarcely cold, and
the dead bodies of the peasants that yet strewed the plains
of Germany, Luther&mdash;none could certainly have imagined
such a thing&mdash;Luther married.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">The Nuns of Nimptsch&mdash;Luther's Sentiments&mdash;The Convent dissolved&mdash;Luther's
Marriage&mdash;Domestic Happiness.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">THE NUNS OF NIMPTSCH.</div>

<p>In the monastery of Nimptsch, near Grimma in Saxony,
dwelt in the year 1523 nine nuns, who were diligent in
reading the Word of God, and who had discovered the contrast
that exists between a christian and a cloistered life.
Their names were Magdalen Staupitz, Eliza Canitz, Ava
Grossen, Ava and Margaret Schonfeldt, Laneta Golis,
Margaret and Catherine Zeschau, and Catherine Bora. The
first impulse of these young women, after they were delivered
from the superstitions of the monastery, was to write
to their parents. "The salvation of our souls," said they,
"will not permit us to remain any longer in a cloister."<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
Their parents, fearing the trouble likely to arise from such
a resolution, harshly rejected their prayers. The poor nuns
were dismayed. How can they leave the monastery?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Their timidity was alarmed at so desperate a step. At last,
the horror caused by the papal services prevailed, and they
promised not to leave one another, but to repair in a body to
some respectable place, with order and decency.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Two
worthy and pious citizens of Torgau, Leonard Koppe and
Wolff Tomitzsch, offered their assistance,<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> which they accepted
as coming from God himself, and left the convent of
Nimptsch without any opposition, and as if the hand of the
Lord had opened the doors to them.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Koppe and Tomitzsch
received them in their waggon; and on the 7th of April
1523, the nine nuns, amazed at their own boldness, stopped
in great emotion before the gate of the old Augustine convent
in which Luther resided.</p>

<p>"This is not my doing," said Luther, as he received them;
"but would to God that I could thus rescue all captive consciences
and empty all the cloisters!<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>&mdash;the breach is made!"
Many persons offered to receive these nuns into their houses,
and Catherine Bora found a welcome in the family of the
burgomaster of Wittemberg.</p>

<p>If Luther at that time thought of preparing for any solemn
event, it was to ascend the scaffold, and not to approach the
altar. Many months after this, he still replied to those who
spoke to him of marriage: "God may change my heart, if
it be his pleasure; but now at least I have no thought of
taking a wife; not that I do not feel any attractions in that
estate; I am neither a stock nor a stone; but every day I
expect the death and the punishment of a heretic."<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">END OF THE CONVENT.</div>

<p>Yet everything in the Church was advancing. The habits
of a monastic life, the invention of man, were giving way in
every quarter to those of domestic life, appointed by God.
On Sunday the 9th of October 1524, Luther, having risen as
usual, laid aside the frock of the Augustine monk, and put
on the dress of a secular priest; he then made his appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
in the church, where this change caused a lively satisfaction.
Renovated Christendom hailed with transport everything
that announced that the old things were passed away.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, the last monk quitted the convent; but
Luther remained; his footsteps alone re-echoed through the
long galleries; he sat silent and solitary in the refectory that
had so lately resounded with the babbling of the monks.
An eloquent silence, attesting the triumphs of the Word of
God! The convent had ceased to exist. About the end of
December 1524, Luther sent the keys of the monastery to
the elector, informing him that he should see where it might
please God to feed him.<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> The elector gave the convent to
the university, and invited Luther to continue his residence
in it. The abode of the monks was destined erelong to be
the sanctuary of a christian family.</p>

<p>Luther, whose heart was formed to taste the sweets of
domestic life, honoured and loved the marriage state; it is
even probable that he had some liking for Catherine Bora.
For a long while his scruples and the thought of the calumnies
which such a step would occasion had prevented his
thinking of her; and he had offered the poor Catherine, first
to Baumgartner of Nuremberg,<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> and then to Dr. Glatz of
Orlamund. But when he saw Baumgartner refuse to take
her, and when she had declined to accept Glatz, he asked
himself seriously whether he ought not to think of marrying
her himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S MOTIVES.</div>

<p>His aged father, who had been so grieved when he embraced
a monastic life, was urging him to enter the conjugal
state.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> But one idea above all was daily present before
Luther's conscience, and with greater energy: marriage is an
institution of God,&mdash;celibacy an institution of man. He
had a horror of every thing that emanated from Rome. He
would say to his friends, "I desire to retain nothing of my
papistical life."<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Day and night he prayed and entreated
the Lord to deliver him from his uncertainty. At last a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
single thought broke the last links that still held him captive.
To all the motives of propriety and personal obedience
which led him to apply to himself this declaration of God,
<i>It is not good that man should be alone</i>,<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> was added a motive
of a higher and more powerful nature. He saw that if he
was called to the marriage-state as a man, he was also called
to it as a reformer: this decided him.</p>

<p>"If this monk should marry," said his friend Schurff the
lawyer, "he will make all the world and the devil himself
burst with laughter, and will destroy the work that he has
begun."<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> This remark made a very different impression on
Luther from what might have been supposed. To brave the
world, the devil, and his enemies, and, by an action which
they thought calculated to ruin the cause of the Reformation,
prevent its success being in any measure ascribed to
him&mdash;this was all he desired. Accordingly, boldly raising
his head, he replied, "Well, then, I will do it; I will play
the devil and the world this trick; I will content my father,
and marry Catherine!" Luther, by his marriage, broke
off still more completely from the institutions of the Papacy;
he confirmed the doctrine he had preached, by his
own example, and encouraged timid men to an entire
renunciation of their errors.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> Rome appeared to be recovering
here and there the ground she had lost; she
flattered herself with the hope of victory; and now a loud explosion
scattered terror and surprise through her ranks,
and still more fully disclosed to her the courage of the
enemy she fancied she had crushed. "I will bear witness
to the Gospel," said Luther, "not by my words only, but
also by my works. I am determined, in the face of my
enemies who already exult and raise the shout of victory,
to marry a nun, that they may see and know that they have
not conquered me.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> I do not take a wife that I may live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
long with her; but seeing the nations and the princes
letting loose their fury against me, foreseeing that my end
is near, and that after my death they will again trample my
doctrine under foot, I am resolved for the edification of the
weak to bear a striking testimony to what I teach here
below."<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S MARRIAGE&mdash;SENSATION.</div>

<p>On the 11th of June 1525, Luther went to the house
of his friend and colleague Amsdorff. He desired Pomeranus,
whom he styled emphatically <i>The Pastor</i>, to bless
his union. The celebrated painter Lucas Cranach and
Doctor John Apella witnessed the marriage. Melancthon
was not present.</p>

<p>No sooner was Luther married than all Europe was
disturbed. He was overwhelmed with accusations and
calumnies from every quarter. "It is incest," exclaimed
Henry VIII. "A monk has married a vestal," said some.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>&mdash;"Antichrist
will be the offspring of such a union," said
others; "for a prophecy announces that he will be born of
a monk and a nun." To this Erasmus replied with a
sarcastic smile: "If the prophecy is true, what thousands
of antichrists do not already exist in the world!"<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> But
while Luther was thus assailed, many wise and moderate
men, whom the Roman Church still counted among her
members, undertook his defence. "Luther," said Erasmus,
"has taken a wife from the noble family of Bora, but she
has no dowry."<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> A more valuable testimony was now
given in his favour. The master of Germany, Philip
Melancthon, whom this bold step had at first alarmed,
said with that grave voice to which even his enemies
listened with respect: "It is false and slanderous to
maintain that there is anything unbecoming in Luther's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
marriage.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> I think that in marrying he must have done
violence to himself. A married life is one of humility, but
it is also a holy state, if there be any such in the world,
and the Scriptures everywhere represent it as honourable in
the eyes of God."</p>

<p>Luther was troubled at first when he saw such floods of
anger and contempt poured out upon him; Melancthon
became more earnest in friendship and kindness towards
him;<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> and it was not long before the reformer could see a
mark of God's approbation in this opposition of man. "If
I did not offend the world," said he, "I should have cause
to fear that what I have done is displeasing to God."<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S DOMESTIC HAPPINESS.</div>

<p>Eight years had elapsed between the time when Luther
had attacked the indulgences and his marriage with Catherine
Bora. It would be difficult to ascribe, as is still done, his
zeal against the abuses of the Church to an "impatient
desire" for wedlock. He was then forty-two years old,
and Catherine Bora had already been two years in Wittemberg.</p>

<p>Luther was happy in this union. "The best gift of
God," said he, "is a pious and amiable wife, who fears God,
loves her family, with whom a man may live in peace, and
in whom he may safely confide." Some months after his
marriage he informed one of his friends of Catherine's pregnancy,<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
and a year after they came together she gave birth
to a son.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> The sweets of domestic life soon dispersed the
storms that the exasperation of his enemies had at first
gathered over him. His Ketha, as he styled her, manifested
the tenderest affection towards him, consoled him in
his dejection by repeating passages from the Bible, exonerated
him from all household cares, sat near him during
his leisure moments, worked his portrait in embroidery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
reminded him of the friends to whom he had forgotten
to write, and often amused him by the simplicity of her
questions. A certain dignity appears to have marked
her character, for Luther would sometimes call her, <i>My
Lord Ketha</i>. One day he said playfully, that if he were to
marry again, he would carve an obedient wife for himself
out of a block of stone, for, added he, "it is impossible to
find such a one in reality." His letters overflowed with tenderness
for Catherine; he called her "his dear and gracious
wife, his dear and amiable Ketha." Luther's character became
more cheerful in Catherine's society, and this happy
frame of mind never deserted him afterwards, even in the
midst of his greatest trials.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADVANTAGES OF ABOLISHING CELIBACY.</div>

<p>The almost universal corruption of the clergy had brought
the priesthood into general contempt, from which the isolated
virtues of a few faithful servants of God had been unable
to extricate it. Domestic peace and conjugal fidelity,
those surest foundations of happiness here below, were continually
disturbed in town and country by the gross passions
of the priests and monks. No one was secure from those
attempts at seduction. They took advantage of the access
allowed them into every family, and sometimes even of the
confidence of the confessional, to instil a deadly poison into
the souls of their penitents, and to satisfy their guilty desires.
The Reformation, by abolishing the celibacy of the ecclesiastics,
restored the sanctity of the conjugal state. The
marriage of the clergy put an end to an immense number of
secret crimes. The reformers became the models of their
flocks in the most intimate and important relations of life;
and the people were not slow in rejoicing to see the ministers
of religion once more husbands and fathers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">The Landgrave&mdash;The Elector&mdash;Prussia&mdash;Reformation&mdash;Secularization&mdash;The
Archbishop of Mentz&mdash;Conference at Friedwalt&mdash;Diet&mdash;Alliance of
Torgau&mdash;Resistance of the Reformers&mdash;Alliance of Magdeburg&mdash;The
Catholics redouble their Exertions&mdash;The Emperor's Marriage&mdash;Threatening
Letters&mdash;The two Parties.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">THE LANDGRAVE&mdash;THE ELECTOR.</div>

<p>At the first glance, Luther's marriage had, in truth, seemed
to add to the difficulties of the Reformation. It was still
suffering from the blow inflicted on it by the revolt of the peasants;
the sword of the emperor and of the princes was yet
unsheathed against it; and its friends, the Landgrave Philip
and the new Elector John, appeared discouraged and silenced.</p>

<p>This state of things did not, however, last long. The
youthful landgrave in a short time boldly raised his head.
Ardent and courageous as Luther, the noble character of the
reformer had won his esteem. He threw himself into the
Reformation with all the enthusiasm of a young man, and
at the same time studied it with all the gravity of a superior
mind.</p>

<p>In Saxony, Frederick's place could not be supplied either
in discretion or in influence; but his brother, the Elector
John, instead of confining himself to the passive part of a
protector, interposed more directly and with greater courage
in religious affairs. As he was leaving Weimar on the 16th
of August 1525, he said to the assembled clergy, "I desire
that you will in future preach the pure Word of God, without
any additions of man." Some aged ecclesiastics, who were
puzzled how to obey his directions, replied artlessly, "But
we are not forbidden to say mass for the dead, or to bless
the water and salt?"&mdash;"Everything," said the elector, "ceremonies
as well as sermons, must be conformed to God's
Word."</p>

<p>Erelong the landgrave formed the extraordinary project
of converting his father-in-law, Duke George. At one time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
he would establish the sufficiency of Scripture; at another,
he would attack the mass, the papacy, and compulsory vows.
Letter followed letter, and all the declarations of the Word
of God were in turns opposed to the faith of the aged duke.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>These efforts did not prove unavailing. The son of Duke
George was won to the new doctrine. But Philip did not
succeed with the father. "A hundred years hence we
shall see who is right," said the latter. "A terrible saying,"
observed the Elector of Saxony; "what can that faith be
which requires such long experience?<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Poor duke!......he
will wait long enough. I fear God has hardened his heart,
as he did Pharaoh's of old."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HEAD OF THE REFORM PARTY&mdash;PRUSSIA.</div>

<p>In Philip the evangelical party found a bold and intelligent
leader, capable of making head against the terrible
attacks the enemy were planning against them. But have
we not cause to regret that the chief of the Reformation
should have been from this moment a man of the sword, and
not simply a disciple of the Word of God? The human element
expanded in the Reformation, and the spiritual element
declined. This was injurious to the work; for every work
should develop itself in accordance with the laws of its own
nature, and the Reformation was of a nature essentially spiritual.</p>

<p>God was adding to the number of its supporters. Prussia,
that powerful state on the frontiers of Germany, had already
taken its station with joy under the banner of the Gospel.
The chivalrous and religious spirit which had founded the
Teutonic order gradually faded away with the ages in which
it had arisen. The knights, consulting their own interests
alone, had dissatisfied the people under their rule. Poland
had taken advantage of this in 1466 to compel the order to recognise
her supremacy. The people, the knights, the grand-master,
the Polish domination, were so many contrary powers
ever in collision and rendering the prosperity of the country
impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SECULARIZATION.</div>

<p>Then came the Reformation, and it was perceived that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
this was the only means of salvation remaining for the
unhappy people. Brismann, Speratus, Poliander who had
been Dr. Eck's secretary at the Leipsic dispute, and many
others, preached the Gospel in Prussia.</p>

<p>One day a mendicant from the country under the rule
of the Teutonic knights, arrived at Wittemberg, and stopping
before Luther's house, sang with a solemn voice the
beautiful hymn by Poliander:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"To us at last salvation's come!"<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a><br />
</p>

<p>The reformer, who had never heard this christian strain,
listened in astonishment and rapture; the foreign accent of
the singer added to his delight: "Again, again," said he
when the mendicant had finished. He then asked where he
had learned the hymn; and his tears began to flow when
the poor man informed him that a cry of deliverance was
sounding from the shores of the Baltic even to Wittemberg.
Luther clasped his hands and thanked God.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>In truth the tidings of salvation had gone thither.</p>

<p>"Have pity on our wretched state," said the people of
Prussia to the grand-master, "and give us preachers who
teach the pure doctrine of the Gospel." Albert at first
made no reply; but entered into correspondence with Sigismund,
king of Poland, his uncle and lord-suzerain.</p>

<p>The latter recognised him as hereditary duke of Prussia,<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>
and the new prince made a public entry into his capital of
Konigsberg with the ringing of bells and the acclamations
of the people; all the houses were splendidly decorated, and
the streets strewn with flowers. "There is but one order,"
said Albert, "and that is Christianity." The monastic orders
were disappearing, and this Divine order was re-established.</p>

<p>The bishops resigned their secular rights to the new duke;
the convents were changed into hospitals, the Gospel was
preached in the meanest villages, and in the following year
Albert married Dorothea, daughter of the King of Denmark,
whose "faith in the one only Saviour" was not to be
shaken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>The pope called upon the emperor to take severe measures
against this "apostate" monk, and Charles laid Albert under
an interdict.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARCHBISHOP OF MENTZ&mdash;REFORMS.</div>

<p>Another prince of the family of Brandenburg, the Cardinal-archbishop
of Mentz, was then on the point of following
his cousin's example. The peasant-wars more especially
threatened the ecclesiastical states; the elector, Luther, and
all Germany imagined they were on the eve of a great revolution.
The archbishop, thinking the only way of preserving
his principality would be to secularize it, secretly
invited Luther to prepare the people for this daring step,<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>
which the latter did by a letter addressed to the archbishop
and intended to be made public: "God," said he, "has laid
his heavy hand upon the clergy; they must fall, nothing can
save them."<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> But the peasant-war having come to an end
more speedily than had been anticipated, the cardinal kept
his temporal possessions; his anxiety disappeared, and he
renounced his plans of secularization.</p>

<p>While John of Saxony, Philip of Hesse, and Albert of
Prussia were taking so prominent a part in the Reformation,
and instead of the prudent Frederick three princes were found
full of resolution and courage, the holy work was advancing
in the Church and among the nations. Luther entreated the
elector to establish the evangelical ministry instead of the
Roman priesthood, and to direct a general visitation of the
churches.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> About the same time they were beginning at
Wittemberg to exercise the episcopal functions and to ordain
ministers. "Let not the pope, the bishops, the monks, and
the priests exclaim: 'We are the Church; whosoever separates
from us, separates from the Church!' There is no other
Church than the assembly of those who have the Word of
God, and who are purified by it."<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> Such was the language
of Melancthon.</p>

<p>All this could not be said and done without occasioning
a strong reaction. Rome had thought the Reformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
extinguished in the blood of the rebellious peasants: but its
flames burst forth again in every quarter with greater power
and brightness. She resolved on making another effort.
The pope and the emperor wrote threatening letters,&mdash;the
one from Rome, the other from Spain. The imperial government
prepared to set matters on their old footing; and the
idea was seriously entertained of effectually crushing the
Reformation in the approaching diet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRIEDEWALT&mdash;THE DIET.</div>

<p>On the 7th of November, the electoral prince of Saxony
and the landgrave met in alarm at the castle of Friedewalt,
and agreed that their deputies at the diet should act in
concert. Thus in the forest of Sullingen were created the
first elements of an evangelical alliance, in opposition to the
leagues of Ratisbon and Dessau.</p>

<p>The diet opened at Augsburg on the 11th of December.
The evangelical princes were not present in person. From
the very first the deputies of Saxony and Hesse spoke out
boldly: "The insurrection of the peasants," said they,
"was owing to an impolitic severity. It is neither by fire
nor sword that God's truth can be torn from the heart. If
you determine to employ violent measures against the Reformation,
more terrible calamities will befall you than those
from which you have so recently and so narrowly escaped."</p>

<p>It was felt that whatever resolution was adopted, its
results would be of the greatest importance. Every one
desired to put off the decisive moment, in order to increase
his own strength. They therefore determined to assemble
again at Spires in the month of May following; and that in
the meanwhile the <i>recess</i> of Nuremberg should continue in
force. Then, said they, we will enter thoroughly into the
subject "of the holy faith, of justice, and of peace."</p>

<p>The landgrave persevered in his plan. He had a conference
with the elector at Gotha at the end of February
1526. These two princes agreed that if they were attacked on
account of the Word of God, they should unite their forces
to resist their adversaries. This alliance was ratified at
Torgau, and was destined to produce important results.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESISTANCE OF THE REFORMERS.</div>

<p>The alliance of Torgau did not satisfy the landgrave.
Convinced that Charles V. was endeavouring to form a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
league "against Christ and his holy Word," he wrote letter
after letter to the elector, representing to him the necessity
of combining with other states. "As for me," wrote he,
"I would rather die than renounce the Word of God and
allow myself to be driven from my throne."<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>There was great uncertainty at the electoral court. In
fact, a serious obstacle stood in the way of any union between
the evangelical princes, and this obstacle was Luther
and Melancthon. Luther desired that the evangelical
doctrine should be defended by God alone. He thought
that the less men interfered with it, the more striking would
be God's interposition. It seemed to him that whatever
measures they desired to take, they must be ascribed to an
unworthy timidity or a blamable mistrust. Melancthon
feared that the alliance of the evangelical princes would
precipitate that very struggle which they were desirous of
avoiding.</p>

<p>The landgrave was not to be checked by these considerations,
and he endeavoured to bring the neighbouring states
into the alliance; but his exertions were not crowned with
success. Frankfort refused to enter it. The Elector of Treves
abandoned his opposition and accepted a pension from the
emperor. Even the elector-palatine, whose evangelical disposition
was well known, rejected Philip's proposals.</p>

<p>Thus the landgrave failed on the side of the Rhine; but
the elector, notwithstanding the opinions of the theologians
of the Reformation, entered into negotiations with the princes
who had at all times rallied round the powerful house of
Saxony. On the 12th of June, the elector and his son, the
Dukes Philip, Ernest, Otho, and Francis of Brunswick and
Luneburg, Duke Henry of Mecklenburg, Prince Wolff of
Anhalt, Counts Albert and Gebhard of Mansfeldt, assembled
at Magdeburg; and there, under the presidence of the elector,
they formed an alliance similar to that of Torgau.</p>

<p>"Almighty God," said these princes, "having in his unspeakable
mercy revived among men his holy and eternal
Word, the food of our souls, and our greatest treasure here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
below; and great exertions having been made on the part of
the clergy and their adherents to suppress and extirpate it,
we, being firmly assured that He who hath sent it to glorify
His name upon earth, will also know how to maintain it,
bind ourselves to preserve that blessed Word for our people,
and to that end to employ our goods, our lives, our states,
our subjects, and all that we possess; putting our trust, not
in our armies, but solely in the omnipotence of the Lord,
whose instruments we desire to be."<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> Such was the language
of the princes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALLIANCE OF MAGDEBURG.</div>

<p>Two days after, the city of Magdeburg was received into
the alliance, and the new duke of Prussia, Albert of Brandenburg,
acceded to it by a separate treaty.</p>

<p>The evangelical alliance was thus formed; but the perils
that it was intended to avert became every day more threatening.
The clergy and the princes friendly to Rome had
seen the Reformation, which they had thought stifled, suddenly
growing up before them in a formidable shape. Already
the partisans of the Reformation were almost as powerful as
those of the pope. If they had a majority in the diet, the
consequences to the ecclesiastical states might easily be
imagined. Now or never! It is no longer a question of
refuting a heresy; they have to contend against a powerful
party. Other victories than those of Dr. Eck are required to
save Christendom.</p>

<p>Effectual precautions had already been taken. The metropolitan
chapter of the collegiate church at Mentz had called
a meeting of all its suffragans, and decided on sending a deputation
to the emperor and the pope, calling on them to
preserve the Church.</p>

<p>At the same time, Duke George of Saxony, Duke Henry
of Brunswick, and the Cardinal-elector Albert, had met at
Halle, and resolved to address a memorial to Charles V.
"The detestable doctrine of Luther," said they, "is making
rapid progress. Every day attempts are made to gain over
even us; and as they cannot succeed by gentle measures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
they are striving to compel us, by exciting our subjects to
revolt. We implore the assistance of the emperor."<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> Immediately
after this conference, Brunswick himself set out
for Spain in order to influence Charles's determination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EMPEROR'S MARRIAGE&mdash;THREATENING LETTER.</div>

<p>He could not have arrived at a more favourable moment;
the emperor had just concluded the famous treaty of Madrid
with France; he seemed to have nothing more to fear in
that quarter, and his eyes were now turned solely towards
Germany. Francis I. had offered to defray a moiety of the
expenses of a war, either against the heretics or against the
Turks.</p>

<p>The emperor was at Seville, where he was about to marry
a princess of Portugal, and the banks of the Guadalquivir
re-echoed with the noise of his festivities. A glittering train
of nobles and a vast concourse of people crowded that ancient
capital of the Moors. Under the arched roof of its magnificent
cathedral were displayed all the pompous ceremonies of
the Church; a legate from the pope officiated, and never,
even under the dominion of the Arabs, had Andalusia witnessed
a spectacle of greater splendour and solemnity.</p>

<p>At this very moment Henry of Brunswick arrived from
Germany, and besought Charles to rescue the empire and
the Church from the attacks of the monk of Wittemberg.
His request was immediately taken into consideration, and
the emperor decided on adopting vigorous measures.</p>

<p>On the 23d of March 1526, he wrote to several of the
princes and cities that had remained faithful to Rome. At
the same time he gave Henry of Brunswick a special commission
to inform them verbally that he had been seriously
grieved to learn that the continual progress of the Lutheran
heresy threatened to fill Germany with sacrilege, devastation,
and bloodshed; that on the contrary he beheld with extreme
pleasure the fidelity of the majority of the states; that, laying
aside all other occupations, he was about to leave Spain and
repair to Rome, to come to an understanding with the pope,
and from thence proceed to Germany to fight against the
abominable pest of Wittemberg; that, on their parts, it was
their duty to adhere to their faith; and if the Lutherans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
sought to lead them into error by stratagem or force, they
should form a close alliance and boldly resist them; and
that he would soon arrive and support them with all his
power.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S AID.</div>

<p>When Brunswick returned to Germany, the Romish party
were transported with joy and proudly lifted up their heads.
The Dukes of Brunswick and Pomerania, Albert of Mecklenburg,
John of Juliers, George of Saxony, the Dukes of
Bavaria, and all the princes of the Church, thought themselves
secure of victory, as they read the menacing letters of
the conqueror of Francis I. They resolved to attend the
approaching diet, to humble the heretical princes, and if
they did not submit, to compel them by the sword. Duke
George is reported to have said, "I may be Elector of
Saxony whenever I please;"<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> he subsequently, however,
endeavoured to give another meaning to these words.
"Luther's cause will not last long: let him look to it!"
said the duke's chancellor one day at Torgau, with an air of
triumph.</p>

<p>Luther, indeed, was looking to it, but not as the chancellor
understood the expression; he was attentively watching the
motions of the enemies of God's Word, and, like Melancthon,
imagined he saw thousands of swords unsheathed against
the Gospel. But he sought for other and higher strength
than that of man. "Satan," wrote he to Frederick Myconius,
"is putting forth his fury; ungodly pontiffs are conspiring;
and we are threatened with war. Exhort the people to contend
valiantly before the throne of the Lord by faith and
prayer, so that our enemies, vanquished by the Spirit of
God, may be constrained to peace. Our chief want, our
chief labour is prayer; let the people know that they are
now exposed to the edge of the sword and to the rage of
Satan, and let them pray."<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TWO PARTIES.</div>

<p>Thus were all things tending towards a decisive struggle.
The Reformation had on its side the prayers of Christians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the sympathy of the people, and an increasing influence over
men's minds that no power could check. The papacy had
in its favour the ancient order of things, the strength of old
custom, the zeal and hatred of formidable princes, and the
power of that mighty emperor who reigned over two worlds,
and who had just before given so rude a check to the ambition
of Francis the First.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs when the Diet of Spires was
opened. Now let us return to Switzerland.</p>

<h2>BOOK XI.</h2>

<h3>DIVISIONS.<br />

SWITZERLAND&mdash;GERMANY. 1523-1527.</h3>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Unity in Diversity&mdash;Primitive Fidelity and Liberty&mdash;Formation of Romish
Unity&mdash;Leo Juda and the Monk&mdash;Zwingle's Theses&mdash;The Disputation
of January.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">UNITY IN DIVERSITY&mdash;PRIMITIVE LIBERTY.</div>

<p>We are about to contemplate the diversities, or, as they have
been called, the <i>variations</i> of the Reformation. These diversities
are one of its most essential characteristics.</p>

<p>Unity in diversity and diversity in unity, is a law of nature
as well as of the Church.</p>

<p>Truth is like the light of the sun: it descends from
heaven one and ever the same; and yet it assumes different
colours upon earth, according to the objects on which it
fails. In like manner, formularies somewhat different may
sometimes express the same christian idea considered under
different aspects.</p>

<p>How dull would creation be if this boundless variety of
forms and colours, which gives it beauty, were replaced by
an absolute uniformity! But how melancholy also would
be its appearance, if all created beings did not form a magnificent
unity!</p>

<p>Divine unity has its rights, so also has human diversity.
In religion we must suppress neither God nor man. If you
have not unity, your religion is not of God; if you have
not diversity, the religion is not of man; but it ought to be
of both. Would you erase from creation one of the laws
that God himself has imposed on it,&mdash;that of infinite diversity?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
<i>And even things without life giving sound, whether
pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds,
how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</i><a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> But if
there is a diversity in religion arising from the difference of
individuality, and which consequently must subsist even in
heaven, there is one that proceeds from man's rebellion, and
this is indeed a great calamity.</p>

<p>There are two tendencies which equally lead us into error.
The one exaggerates diversity, the other exaggerates unity.
The essential doctrines of salvation are the limit between
these two courses. To require more than these doctrines, is to
infringe this diversity; to require less, is to infringe unity.</p>

<p>The latter excess is that of rash and rebellious minds,
who look beyond Jesus Christ to form systems and doctrines
of men.</p>

<p>The former exists in various exclusive sects, and particularly
in that of Rome.</p>

<p>The Church should reject error, and unless this be done,
Christianity cannot be maintained. But if this idea were
carried to extremes, it would follow that the Church should
take arms against the least deviation, and put herself in
motion for mere verbal disputes. Faith would thus be fettered,
and the feelings of Christians reduced to bondage.
Such was not the condition of the Church in the times of
real catholicity,&mdash;the catholicity of the primitive ages. She
rejected the sects that attacked the fundamental truths
of the Gospel; but these truths once received, it left full
liberty to faith. Rome soon departed from this wise course;
and in proportion as the dominion and teaching of men arose
in the Church, there sprung up by their side a unity of
man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FORMATION OF ROMISH UNITY.</div>

<p>When a merely human system had been once invented,
coercion increased from age to age. The christian liberty,
respected by the catholicism of the earlier ages, was at first
limited, then enslaved, and finally stifled. Conviction, which
according to the laws of human nature and of the Word of
God should be freely formed in the heart and understanding
of man, was imposed from without, completely formed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
symmetrically arranged by the masters of mankind. Reflection,
will, feeling, all the faculties of the human being,
which, subjected to the Word and Spirit of God, should
work and bear fruit freely, were deprived of their liberty, and
constrained to expand in shapes that had been determined
upon beforehand. The mind of man became as a mirror
on which extraneous objects are reflected, but which possesses
nothing by itself. Doubtless there still existed many
souls that had been taught direct of God. But the great
majority of Christians from that time received the convictions
of others only; a faith peculiar to the individual was rare;
it was the Reformation alone that restored this treasure to
the Church.</p>

<p>And yet for some time there was a space within which the
human mind was permitted to move; there were certain opinions
that might be received or rejected at will. But as a hostile
army day by day presses closer to a besieged city, compels
the garrison to move only within the narrow boundary of its
ramparts, and at last forces it to surrender; so the hierarchy,
from age to age, and almost from year to year, contracted
the space that it had temporarily granted to the human
mind, until at last this space, from continual encroachments,
had ceased to exist. All that man ought to love, believe, or
do, was regulated and decreed in the offices of the Roman
chancery. The faithful were relieved of the fatigue of examining,
of reflecting, of contending; all that they had to do
was to repeat the formularies they had been taught.</p>

<p>From that time, if there appeared in the bosom of Roman-catholicism
any one who had inherited the catholicism of the
apostolic ages, such a man feeling his inability to expand in
the bonds in which he was confined, was compelled to snap
them asunder, and display again to the astonished world the
unfettered bearing of a Christian, who acknowledges no law
save that of God.</p>

<p>The Reformation, by restoring liberty to the Church, was
destined also to restore its original diversity, and to people
it with families united by the great features of resemblance
they derive from their common parent; but different in
their secondary features, and reminding us of the varieties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
inherent in human nature. Perhaps it would have been desirable
for this diversity to exist in the universal Church without
leading to sectarian divisions. Nevertheless, we must not
forget that these sects are but the expression of this diversity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SWITZERLAND AND GERMANY.</div>

<p>Switzerland and Germany, which had till this time developed
themselves independently of each other, began
to come in contact in the years whose history we are about
to retrace, and realized the diversity of which we have been
speaking, and which was to be one of the characteristics of
Protestantism. We shall there behold men perfectly agreed
on all the great doctrines of faith, and yet differing on
certain secondary points. Passion, indeed, entered into
these discussions; but while deploring such a melancholy
intermixture, Protestantism, far from seeking to conceal her
diversity, publishes and proclaims it. Its path to unity is
long and difficult, but this unity is the real unity.</p>

<p>Zwingle was advancing in the christian life. While the
Gospel had freed Luther from that profound melancholy to
which he had formerly given way in the convent of Erfurth,
and had developed in him a serenity which often amounted
to gaiety, and of which the reformer afterwards gave so many
proofs, even in the face of great dangers, Christianity had
produced the very opposite effect on the joyous child of the
Tockenburg mountains. Tearing Zwingle from his thoughtless
and worldly life, it had imprinted a seriousness on his
character that was not natural to him. This seriousness was
very necessary to him. We have seen how towards the
close of the year 1522 numerous enemies appeared rising
up against the Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> Zwingle was overwhelmed
with reproaches from every quarter, and disputes would often
take place even in the churches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEO JUDA AND THE MONK&mdash;ZWINGLE'S THESES.</div>

<p>Leo Juda, who (says an historian) was a man of small
stature,<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> but full of love for the poor, and zeal against false
teachers, had arrived at Zurich about the end of the year
1522 to occupy the station of pastor of St. Peter's church. He
had been replaced at Einsidlen by Oswald Myconius.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
was a valuable acquisition for Zwingle and for the Reformation.</p>

<p>One day, not long after his arrival, as he was in the
church of which he had been appointed pastor, he heard an
Augustine monk asserting forcibly that man is able of himself
to satisfy the righteousness of God. "Reverend father
prior," said Leo, "listen to me for an instant; and you, my
dear citizens, keep still; I will speak as becomes a Christian."
He then proved to the people the falseness of the
doctrine to which he had been listening.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Upon this a
great disturbance arose in the church; and immediately
several persons angrily fell upon "the little priest" from
Einsidlen. Zwingle appeared before the great council, requiring
permission to give an account of his doctrine in the
presence of the deputies of the bishop; and the council,
desirous of putting an end to these disturbances, convened a
conference for the 29th of January 1523. The news spread
rapidly through the whole of Switzerland. His adversaries
exclaimed in their vexation: "A <i>diet</i> of vagabonds is to
be held at Zurich; all the beggars from the highways will
be there."</p>

<p>Zwingle, desiring to prepare for the struggle, published
sixty-seven theses. The mountaineer of the Tockenburg
boldly assailed the pope in the eyes of all Switzerland.</p>

<p>"All those (said he) who maintain that the Gospel is
nothing without the confirmation of the Church, blaspheme
God.</p>

<p>"Jesus Christ is the only way of salvation for all those
who have been, who are, or who shall be.</p>

<p>"All Christians are Christ's brethren, and brethren of one
another, and they have no father upon earth: thus orders,
sects, and parties fall to the ground.</p>

<p>"We should not constrain those who will not acknowledge
their error, unless they disturb the public peace by their
seditious behaviour."</p>

<p>Such were some of Zwingle's propositions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DISPUTATION OF JANUARY.</div>

<p>Early in the morning of Thursday the 29th of January,
more than six hundred persons had collected in the hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of the Great Council at Zurich. Citizens and strangers,
scholars, men of rank and the clergy, had responded to the
call of the council. "What will be the end of all this?"
asked they of one another.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> No one ventured to reply; but
the attention, emotion, and agitation prevailing in this
assembly, clearly manifested that they were expecting some
extraordinary result.</p>

<p>The burgomaster Roust, who had fought at Marignan,
presided at the conference. The chevalier James d'Anwyl,
grand-master of the episcopal court at Constance, the vicar-general
Faber, and many other doctors, were present as the
bishop's representatives. Sebastian Hofmeister had been
sent by Schaffhausen, and he was the only deputy from the
cantons: such was still the weakness of the Reformation in
Switzerland. On a table in the middle of the hall lay a
Bible; in front of it sat Zwingle: "I am agitated and tormented
on every side," he had said, "and yet I stand firm,
relying not on my own strength, but on Christ the rock,
with whose help I can do all things."<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>Zwingle stood up and said: "I have preached that salvation
is found in Jesus Christ alone, and for this reason I am
stigmatized throughout Switzerland as a heretic, a seducer
of the people, a rebel......Now, then, in the name of God,
here I stand!"<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>Upon this all eyes were turned towards Faber, who rose
and made answer: "I was not sent here to dispute, but
merely to listen!" The assembly in surprise began to laugh.
"The Diet of Nuremberg," continued Faber, "has promised
a council within a year; we must wait until it meets."</p>

<p>"What!" said Zwingle, "is not this vast and learned
meeting as good as any council?" Then turning to the
presidents, he added: "Gracious lords, defend the Word of
God."</p>

<div class="sidenote">SILENCE&mdash;VICTORY.</div>

<p>A deep silence followed this appeal; it was interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
by the burgomaster, who said: "If there is any one here
who has anything to say, let him do so." There was
another pause. "I call upon all those who have accused
me, and I know that there are several here," said Zwingle,
"to come forward and reprove me for the love of truth."
No one said a word. Zwingle repeated his request a second
and third time, but to no purpose. Faber, thus closely
pressed, dropped for an instant the reserve he had imposed
on himself, to declare that he had convicted the pastor
of Filispach of his error, and who was now confined in
prison; but immediately after resumed his character as a
spectator. It was in vain that he was urged to set forth the
reasons by which he had convinced this pastor: he obstinately
refused. This silence on the part of the Romish
doctors tired the patience of the meeting. A voice was
heard exclaiming from the farther part of the hall: "Where
are now these valiant fellows,<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> who talk so loudly in the
streets? Come along, step forward, there's your man!" No
one moved. Upon this the burgomaster said with a smile:
"It would appear that this famous sword with which you
smote the pastor of Filispach will not come out of its sheath
to-day;" and he then broke up the meeting.</p>

<p>When the assembly met again in the afternoon, the council
declared that Master Ulrich Zwingle, not being reproved
by any one, might continue to preach the holy Gospel, and
that the rest of the clergy in the canton should teach nothing
that they could not substantiate by Scripture.</p>

<p>"Praised be God, who will cause his holy Word to prevail
in heaven and earth!" exclaimed Zwingle. Upon this
Faber could not restrain his indignation. "The theses of
Master Ulrich," said he, "are contrary to the honour of the
Church and the doctrine of Christ; and I will prove it." "Do
so," replied Zwingle. But Faber declined his challenge, except
it should be at Paris, Cologne, or Friburg. "I will have no
other judge than the Gospel," said Zwingle. "Sooner than
you can shake one of its words, the earth will open before
you."<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> "The Gospel!" sneered Faber, "always the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Gospel!......Men might live in holiness, peace, and charity, even
if there were no Gospel."<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>At these words the spectators rose indignantly from their
seats. Thus terminated the disputation.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Papal Temptations&mdash;Progress of the Reformation&mdash;The Idol at Stadelhofen&mdash;Sacrilege&mdash;The
Ornaments of the Saints.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">PAPAL TEMPTATIONS.</div>

<p>The Reformation had gained the day; it was now to accelerate
its conquests. After this battle of Zurich, in which the
most skilful champions of the papacy were dumb, who would
be bold enough to oppose the new doctrine? But weapons
of a different kind were tried. Zwingle's firmness and republican
bearing overawed his adversaries; accordingly they
had recourse to peculiar measures to subdue him. While
Rome was pursuing Luther with her anathemas, she endeavoured
to win over the reformer of Zurich by gentleness.
The dispute was scarcely ended when Zwingle received a
visit from the captain of the pope's guard&mdash;the son of the
burgomaster Roust. He was accompanied by the legate
Einsius, the bearer of a papal brief, in which Adrian VI.
called Zwingle his beloved son, and assured him of "his
special favour."<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> At the same time the pope urged Zink
to gain over Zwingle. "And what has the pope commissioned
you to offer him?" asked Oswald Myconius. "Everything,"
replied Zink, "except the papal chair."<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S FIRMNESS&mdash;FABER'S HOSTILITY.</div>

<p>There was no mitre, or crozier, or cardinal's hat, that the
pope would not have given to bribe the reformer of Zurich.
But Rome was strangely mistaken in this respect; all her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
proposals were unavailing. In Zwingle, the Romish Church
had a still more pitiless enemy than Luther. He cared far
less than the Saxon reformer for the ideas and ceremonies
of former ages; it was enough for him that any custom,
however innocent in itself, was connected with some abuse;
he fell violently upon it. The Word of God (thought he)
should stand alone.</p>

<p>But if Rome understood so imperfectly what was then
taking place in Christendom, she found counsellors who endeavoured
to put her in the way.</p>

<p>Faber, exasperated at seeing the pope thus humble himself
before his adversary, hastened to enlighten him. He
was a courtier with a constant smile upon his lips and
honied words in his mouth; to judge from his own language,
he was everybody's friend, even of those whom he accused
of heresy. But his hatred was mortal. Accordingly, the
reformer, playing on his name (Faber), used to say, "the
Vicar of Constance is a lie-smith. Let him openly take up
arms, and see how Christ defends us."<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>These words were no mere idle boasting; for while the
pope was complimenting Zwingle on his eminent virtues,
and the special confidence he placed in him, the enemies
of the reformer were increasing in number throughout Switzerland.
The veteran soldiers, the great families, the herdsmen
of the mountains, combined their hatred against this
doctrine which thwarted their tastes. At Lucerne, the magnificent
representation of Zwingle's <i>passion</i> was announced; in
effect, the people dragged the reformer's effigy to the scaffold,
shouting out that they were going to put the heretic to
death; and laying hands on some Zurichers who happened
to be at Lucerne, compelled them to be spectators of this
mock execution. "They shall not trouble my repose," said
Zwingle; "Christ will never be wanting to his followers."<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>
Even the diet re-echoed with threats against him. "My dear
confederates," said the councillor of Mullinen to the cantons,
"make a timely resistance to the Lutheran cause......At
Zurich a man is no longer master in his own house!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CRUCIFIX OF STADELHOFEN.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>This agitation among the enemy announced what was
passing in Zurich more loudly than any proclamations
could have done. The victory was indeed bearing fruit;
the conquerors were gradually taking possession of the
country, and every day the Gospel made fresh progress.
Twenty-four canons and a great number of chaplains
voluntarily petitioned the council to reform their statutes.
It was decided to replace these sluggish priests by pious and
learned men, with commission to give the Zurich youth a
Christian and liberal education, and to establish in the place
of their vespers and Latin masses, a daily explanation of
a chapter in the Bible, according to the Hebrew and Greek
texts, first for the learned, and afterwards for the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SACRILEGE&mdash;ORNAMENTS OF THE SAINTS.</div>

<p>There are unfortunately in every army a number of
those desperate heroes who leave their ranks and make
unseasonable attacks on points that ought still to be respected.
A young priest, Louis Hetzer, had published a
treatise in German entitled, <i>The judgment of God against
Images</i>, which produced a great sensation, and the images
wholly engrossed the thoughts of a part of the people. It
is only to the detriment of those essentials that ought to
occupy his mind, that man can fix his attention on secondary
matters. At a place called Stadelhofen, outside the city
gates, stood a crucifix elaborately carved and richly ornamented.
The most zealous partisans of the Reformation,
shocked at the superstitions to which this image gave
rise, could not pass by without giving vent to their
indignation. A citizen named Claude Hottinger, "a
worthy man," says Bullinger, "and well read in the Holy
Scriptures," having fallen in with the miller of Stadelhofen,
to whom the crucifix belonged, asked him when he intended
to throw down his idols. "No one compels you to worship
them," replied the miller.&mdash;"But do you not know," retorted
Hottinger, "that the Word of God forbids us to have any
graven images?"&mdash;"Well then," said the miller, "if you are
authorized to remove them, I abandon them to you." Hottinger
thought himself empowered to act, and shortly after,
about the end of September, he was seen to pass the gates
with a body of citizens. On arriving at the crucifix, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
deliberately dug round it, until the image, yielding to their
efforts, fell to the earth with a loud crash.</p>

<p>This daring action spread dismay on every side: one
might have thought that religion itself had fallen with the
crucifix of Stadelhofen. "They are guilty of sacrilege! They
deserve to be put to death!" exclaimed the friends of Rome.
The council caused the image-breakers to be apprehended.</p>

<p>"No!" cried Zwingle and his colleagues from their pulpits:
"Hottinger and his friends are not guilty in the sight
of God and worthy of death.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> But they may be punished
for having acted with violence and without the sanction of
the magistrates."<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<p>Meantime acts of a similar nature were continually taking
place. A curate of Saint Peter's, one day remarking in front
of the church a number of poor people ill fed and with tattered
garments, said to one of his colleagues, as he turned his eyes
on the costly ornaments of the saints: "I should like to strip
these idols of wood to procure clothing for these poor members
of Jesus Christ." A few days later, at three o'clock in
the morning, the saints and all their ornaments disappeared.
The council flung the curate into prison, notwithstanding he
protested his innocence of this proceeding. "What!" exclaimed
the people, "is it these logs of wood that Jesus
ordered us to clothe? Is it on account of these images that
he will say to the righteous: <i>I was naked, and ye clothed
me</i>?"</p>

<p>Thus, the greater the resistance, the higher soared the
Reformation; and the more it was compressed, the more
energetically did it spring forward, and threaten to overthrow
all that withstood it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISPUTATION OF OCTOBER.</div>

<p>Even these excesses were destined to be salutary; a new
combat was needed to secure fresh triumphs; for in the
things of the Spirit, as in the affairs of the world, there is
no conquest without a struggle; and as the soldiers of Rome
stood motionless, the conflict was to be brought on by the
undisciplined sons of the Reformation. In fact, the magistrates
were embarrassed and agitated; they felt the necessity
of having their consciences enlightened, and with this
view they resolved to appoint another public disputation in
the German language, in which the question of idols should
be examined according to Scripture.</p>

<p>The Bishops of Coire, Constance, and Basle, the university
of the latter city, and the twelve cantons, were accordingly requested
to send deputies to Zurich. But the bishops declined
the invitation, and calling to mind the wretched figure their
deputies had made at the former disputation, they had little
inclination to repeat such humiliating scenes. Let the
evangelicals dispute if they please, but let them dispute
alone. On the first occasion, the Romish party had kept
silence; on the second they were resolved not to appear.
Rome may possibly have imagined that the great combat
would cease for want of combatants. The bishops were
not alone in refusing to attend. The men of Unterwalden
replied that they had no scholars among them, but only
worthy and pious priests, who explained the Gospel as their
fathers had done; that they would send no deputy to
Zwingle "and his fellows;" but that, if he fell into their
hands, they would treat him in such a manner as to deprive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
him of all wish to relapse into the same faults.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> Schaffhausen
and St. Gall alone sent representatives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE ON THE CHURCH.</div>

<p>On the 26th of October, after the sermon, an assembly of
more than nine hundred persons, composed of members of
the Great Council and of three hundred and fifty priests,
filled the large hall of the town-house. Zwingle and Leo
Juda were seated at a table, on which lay the Old and New
Testament in the original languages. Zwingle spoke first,
and overthrowing with a vigorous arm the authority of the
hierarchy and of its councils, established the rights of every
Christian Church, and claimed the liberty of the primitive ages&mdash;of
those times when the Church knew neither general nor
provincial councils. "The universal Church," said he, "is
spread over the whole world, wherever there is faith in
Christ, in India as well as at Zurich......And as for particular
churches, we have them at Berne, at Schaffhausen,
and even here. But the popes, with their cardinals and
their councils, form neither the universal Church nor a particular
Church.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> The assembly before which I now speak,"
continued he with energy, "is the Church of Zurich; it
desires to hear the Word of God, and it has the right of
ordering all that may appear to it conformable with the
Holy Scriptures."</p>

<p>Thus did Zwingle rely on the Church, but on the true
Church; not on the clergy alone, but on the assembly of
Christians,&mdash;on the people. All that the Scriptures say of
the Church in general, he applied to particular churches.
He did not think that any church could err which listened
with docility to the Word of God. In his eyes, the Church
was represented politically and ecclesiastically by the Great
Council.<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> At first he explained every question from the
pulpit; and when his hearers' minds were convinced of the
truth, he carried the matter before the Great Council, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
in harmony with the ministers of the Church, formed such
decisions as the Church called for.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CANON HOFFMAN&mdash;PRESBYTERIANISM.</div>

<p>In the absence of the bishop's deputies, Conrad Hoffmann,
the same aged canon who had procured Zwingle's election
to Zurich, undertook the defence of the pope. He maintained
that the Church, the flock, the "third estate," had no
right to discuss such matters. "I was thirteen years at
Heidelberg," said he, "living in the house of a very great
scholar, whose name was Doctor Joss, a worthy and pious
man, with whom I long ate and drank and led a merry life;
but I always heard him say that it was not proper to discuss
such matters; so you see......" All were ready to
burst into laughter; but the burgomaster checked them.
"Let us therefore wait for a council," continued Hoffmann.
"For the present, I shall not dispute, but obey the bishop's
orders, even should he be a knave!"</p>

<p>"Wait for a council!" replied Zwingle. "And who will
attend a council? The pope with some sluggish and ignorant
bishops who will do nothing but what suits their fancy.
No! the Church is not there! Höng and Küssnacht (these
were two Zurich villages) are certainly more of a church
than all the bishops and popes put together!"</p>

<p>Thus did Zwingle vindicate the rights of the christian
people, whom Rome had deprived of their privileges. The
assembly before which he was speaking was not, in his
judgment, the Church of Zurich, but its first representative.
This is the beginning of the Presbyterian system in the age
of the Reformation. Zwingle was withdrawing Zurich from
the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Constance, separating it
from the Latin hierarchy, and founding on this idea of the
flock, of the christian assembly, a new ecclesiastical constitution,
to which other countries were afterwards to adhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SILENCE OF PRIESTS AND MONKS.</div>

<p>The disputation continued. Many priests having risen to
defend the images, but without having recourse to Holy
Writ, Zwingle and the other reformers confuted them by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Bible. "If no one stands forward to defend the use of
images by arguments derived from Scripture," said one of
the presidents, "we shall call upon some of their advocates
by name." As no one arose, the priest of Wadischwyl was
called. "He is asleep," answered one of the spectators.
The priest of Horgen was next called. "He has sent me in
his place," replied his curate, "but I will not answer for
him." Evidently the power of God's Word was making
itself felt in this assembly. The partisans of the Reformation
were full of energy, liberty, and joy; their adversaries
appeared speechless, uneasy, and dejected. They summoned,
one after another, the parish-priests of Laufen, Glattfelden,
Wetzikon, the rector and priest of Pfaffikon, the dean of Elgg,
the priest of Bäretschwyl, with the Dominicans and Grayfriars,
notorious for their preaching in defence of images, the
virgin, the saints, and the mass; but all made answer that
they could say nothing in their favour, and that henceforward
they would apply themselves to the study of the truth.
"Hitherto," said one of them, "I have put my trust in the
old doctors; now, I will believe in the new."&mdash;"You should
believe not in us, but in God's Word," exclaimed Zwingle.
"It is Scripture alone that can never err!" The sitting had
been long, and night was approaching. The president,
Hofmeister of Schaffhausen, stood up and said: "Blessed
be the Almighty and Everlasting God for that in all things
he has vouchsafed us the victory;" and he then exhorted the
councillors of Zurich to pull down all the images.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the assembly met again in order to discuss
the doctrine of the mass. Vadian was in the chair. "My
brethren in Christ," said Zwingle, "far from us be the
thought that there is any deception or falsehood in the body
and blood of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> Our only aim is to show that the
mass is not a sacrifice that one man can offer to God for
another, unless any one should maintain also that a man
can eat and drink for his friend."</p>

<div class="sidenote">VICTORY.</div>

<p>Vadian having twice demanded if any there present desired
to uphold by Scripture the doctrine impugned, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
one having replied, the canons of Zurich, the chaplains, and
many other ecclesiastics declared that they agreed with
Zwingle.</p>

<p>But scarcely had the reformers thus vanquished the
partisans of the old doctrines, than they had to contend
against those impatient spirits who call for sudden and violent
innovations, and not for wise and gradual reforms. The
wretched Conrad Grebel rose and said: "It is not enough
to have disputed about the mass, we must put an end to
its abuses."&mdash;"The council will draw up an edict on the
subject," replied Zwingle. Upon this Simon Stumpf exclaimed:
"The Spirit of God has already decided: why
refer to the decision of the council?"<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>The commander Schmidt of Küssnacht arose gravely, and
in language full of wisdom said, "Let us teach Christians to
receive Christ in their hearts.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> Until this hour, ye have all
gone after idols. The dwellers in the plain have run to the
mountains, and those of the mountains have gone to the
plain; the French to Germany, and the Germans to France.
Now ye know whither ye ought to go. God has combined
all things in Christ. Ye noble citizens of Zurich! go to the
true source; and may Christ at length re-enter your territory,
and there resume his ancient empire."</p>

<p>This discourse made a deep impression, and no one stood up
to reply to it. Zwingle rose with emotion and said, "Gracious
lords, God is with us......He will defend his cause.
Now, then, forward in the name of God." Here Zwingle's
agitation became so great that he could not proceed. He
wept, and many joined their tears with his.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>Thus ended the disputation. The presidents rose; the
burgomaster thanked them; and the aged warrior, turning
to the council, said gravely, with that voice which had
so often been heard on the field of battle, "Now, then,......let
us grasp the sword of God's Word, and may the Lord
prosper his work."</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF THE SWISS REFORMATION.</div>

<p>This dispute, which took place in the month of October<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
1523, was decisive. The majority of the priests, who had
been present at it, returned full of zeal to the different parts
of the canton, and the effect of these two days was felt
throughout Switzerland. The Church of Zurich, that had
always preserved a certain independence with respect to the
see of Constance, was then entirely emancipated. Instead
of resting on the pope through the bishop, it rested henceforward
through the people on the Word of God. Zurich
recovered the privileges that Rome had taken from her. Town
and country vied with each other in interest for the work of
the Reformation, and the Great Council did but follow the
movements of the people. On all important occasions the
city and the villages made known their opinions. Luther
had restored the Bible to the christian world; Zwingle went
farther, he restored their rights. This is a characteristic
feature of the Swiss Reformation. The maintenance of
sound doctrine was thus confided, under God, to the people;
and recent events have shown that a christian people can
guard this precious deposit better than priests and pontiffs.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

<p>Zwingle did not allow himself to be elated by victory; on
the contrary, the Reformation, according to his wish, was
carried on with great moderation. "God knows my heart,"
said he, when the council asked his advice; "He knows that
I am inclined to build up, and not to throw down. I am aware
that there are timid souls who ought to be conciliated; let
the mass, therefore, for some time longer be read on Sunday
in all the churches, and let us avoid insulting the priests who
celebrate it."<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>The council drew up an edict to this purport. Hottinger
and Hochrutiner, one of his friends, were banished from the
canton for two years, and forbidden to return without permission.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REVIVAL OF LEARNING IN ZURICH.</div>

<p>The Reformation at Zurich followed a prudent and christian
course. Daily raising this city more and more, it surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
her with glory in the eyes of all the friends of the Word
of God. Accordingly those in Switzerland who had saluted
the new light that was dawning upon the Church felt
themselves powerfully attracted towards Zurich. Oswald
Myconius, expelled from Lucerne, had been residing for
six months at Einsidlen, when, as he was returning one
day from a journey he had made to Glaris,<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> oppressed by
fatigue and by the heat of the sun, he saw his little boy Felix
running to meet him, and to tell him that he had been invited
to Zurich to superintend one of the schools. Oswald could
not believe such joyful tidings: he hesitated between fear and
hope.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> "I am thine," wrote he at last to Zwingle. Geroldsek
saw him depart with regret; gloomy thoughts filled his
mind. "Alas!" said he to Oswald, "all those who confess
Christ are going to Zurich; I fear that one day we shall all
perish there together."<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> A melancholy presentiment, which
by the death of Geroldsek himself and of so many other
friends of the Gospel, was but too soon fulfilled on the plains
of Cappel.</p>

<p>At Zurich, Myconius found at last a safe retreat. His
predecessor, who from his stature had been nicknamed at
Paris "the great devil," had neglected his duties; Oswald
devoted all his heart and strength to their fulfilment. He
explained the Greek and Latin classics, taught rhetoric and
logic, and the youth of the city listened to him with delight.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>
Myconius was destined to become for the rising generation
what Zwingle was to those of riper years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THOMAS PLATER.</div>

<p>At first Myconius was alarmed at the advanced age of the
scholars under his care; but he had gradually resumed his
courage, and was not long in distinguishing among his
pupils a young man, twenty-four years of age, from whose
eyes beamed forth a love of study. Thomas Plater, for such
was his name, was a native of the Valais. In that beautiful
valley, where the torrent of the Viége rolls its noisy waters,
after issuing from the sea of ice and snow which encircles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
Mount Rosa, between St. Nicholas and Stalden, on the lofty
hill that rises on the right bank of the river, may still be
seen the village of Grächen. This was Plater's birthplace.
From the neighbourhood of these colossal Alps was to proceed
one of the most original of all the characters that appeared
in the great drama of the sixteenth century. At the
age of nine years, he had been placed under the care of a
priest who was his relation, by whom the little peasant was
often so cruelly beaten that he cried (as he tells us himself)
like a kid under the knife. He was taken by one of his
cousins to attend the German schools. But he had already
attained the age of twenty years, and yet, through running
from school to school, he scarcely knew how to read.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> When
he arrived at Zurich, he came to the determination of gaining
knowledge; and having taken his place in Oswald's
school, he said to himself, "There shalt thou learn or die."
The light of the Gospel shone into his heart. One very cold
morning, when he had no fuel for the school-room stove,
which it was his duty to keep up, he thought to himself: "Why
should you want wood, while there are many idols in the
church!" There was no one as yet in the church, although
Zwingle was to preach, and the bells were already summoning
the congregation. Plater entered very softly, laid hold of an
image of St. John that stood upon an altar, and thrust it into
the stove, saying: "Down with you, for in you must go."
Most assuredly neither Myconius nor Zwingle would have
sanctioned such a proceeding.</p>

<p>It was in truth by better arms than these that incredulity and
superstition were to be combated. Zwingle and his colleagues
had given the hand of fellowship to Myconius; and the
latter daily expounded the New Testament in the church of
Our Lady before an eager and attentive crowd.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> Another
public disputation, held on the 13th and 14th of January
1524, had again proved fatal to Rome; and in vain
did the canon Koch exclaim: "Popes, cardinals, bishops,
councils&mdash;these are my church!"</p>

<p>Everything was making progress in Zurich; men's minds
were becoming more enlightened, their hearts more decided,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and the Reformation was increasing in strength. Zurich
was a fortress gained by the new doctrine, and from her
walls it was about to spread over the whole confederation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Diet of Lucerne&mdash;Hottinger arrested&mdash;His Death&mdash;Deputation from the
Diet to Zurich&mdash;Abolition of religious Processions&mdash;Abolition of
Images&mdash;The Two Reformations&mdash;Appeal to the People.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">DIET OF LUCERNE.</div>

<p>The adversaries were aware of what might be the consequences
of these changes in Zurich. They felt that they
must now decide upon striking a vigorous blow. They had
been silent spectators long enough. The iron-clad warriors
of Switzerland determined to rise at last; and whenever they
arose, the field of battle had been dyed with blood.</p>

<p>The diet had met at Lucerne; the clergy were endeavouring
to excite the chief council of the nation in their favour.
Friburg and the Forest Cantons proved their docile instruments;
Berne, Basle, Soleure, Glaris, and Appenzel were
undecided. Schaffhausen was inclining towards the Gospel;
but Zurich alone stood forward boldly in its defence. The
partisans of Rome urged the assembly to yield to their
demands and prejudices. "Let the people be forbidden," said
they, "to preach or repeat any new or Lutheran doctrine in
private or in public, and to talk or dispute about such
things in taverns and over their wine."<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> Such was the
ecclesiastical law they were desirous of establishing in the
confederation.</p>

<p>Nineteen articles were drawn up to this effect, approved of
by all the states, except Zurich, on the 26th of January 1523,
and sent to all the bailiffs with orders to see that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
strictly observed: "which caused great joy among the
priests," says Bullinger, "and great sorrow among believers."
A persecution, regularly organized by the supreme authority
of the confederation, was about to begin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOTTINGER ARRESTED.</div>

<p>One of the first who received the mandate of the diet was
Henry Flackenstein of Lucerne, bailiff of Baden. Hottinger,
when banished from Zurich for pulling down the crucifix of
Stadelhofen, had retired to this bailiwick, where he had not
concealed his opinions. One day, as he chanced to be dining
at the Angel tavern in Zurzach, he had said that the priests
wrongly interpreted Holy Scripture, and that man should
put his trust in God alone.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> The landlord, who was continually
going in and out to bring bread or wine, listened to
what appeared to him such very extraordinary language.
Another day, Hottinger paid a visit to his friend John Schutz
of Schneyssingen. After they had eaten and drunk together,
Schutz asked him: "What is this new faith that the Zurich
pastors are preaching?" "They preach," replied Hottinger,
"that Christ was sacrificed <i>once</i> for all Christians; that by
this one sacrifice he has purified and redeemed them from all
their sins; and they show by Holy Scripture that the mass
is a lie."</p>

<p>After this (in February 1523), Hottinger had quitted Switzerland,
and gone on business to Waldshut, on the other side
of the Rhine. Measures were taken to seize his person, and
about the end of the same month the poor unsuspecting
Zuricher, having recrossed the river, had scarcely reached
Coblentz, a village on the left bank of the Rhine, before he
was arrested. He was taken to Klingenau, and as he there
frankly confessed his faith, the exasperated Flackenstein said:
"I will take you to a place where you will find people to
make you a suitable answer."</p>

<p>In effect, the bailiff conducted him successively before the
judges of Klingenau, before the superior tribunal of Baden,
and, since he could find no one who would declare him guilty,
before the diet sitting at Lucerne. He was firmly resolved
to seek judges who would condemn his prisoner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOTTINGER'S MARTYRDOM.</div>

<p>The diet lost no time, and condemned Hottinger to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
beheaded. When informed of his sentence, he gave glory to
God: "That will do," said James Troger, one of his judges,
"we do not sit here to listen to sermons. You can have
your talk some other time." "He must have his head taken
off this once," said the bailiff Am Ort, with a laugh; "if he
should ever get it on again, we will all embrace his faith."
"May God forgive all those who have condemned me," said
the prisoner. A monk then presented a crucifix to his lips,
but he put it away, saying: "It is in the heart that we
must receive Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>When he was led out to execution, many of the spectators
could not refrain from tears. "I am going to eternal happiness,"
said he, turning towards them. On reaching the
place where he was to die, he raised his hands to heaven,
exclaiming: "Into thy hands, O my Redeemer, I commit
my spirit!" In another minute his head rolled upon the
scaffold.</p>

<p>The blood of Hottinger was hardly cold before the enemies
of the Reformation seized the opportunity of still further inflaming
the anger of the confederates. It was in Zurich
itself that the mischief should be crushed. The terrible example
that had just been given must have filled Zwingle and
his partisans with terror. Another vigorous effort, and the
death of Hottinger would be followed by that of the Reform......The
diet immediately resolved that a deputation should
be sent to Zurich, calling upon the councils and the citizens
to renounce their faith.</p>

<p>The deputation received an audience on the 21st of March.
"The ancient christian unity is broken," said the deputies;
"the disease is gaining ground; already have the clergy of the
four Forest Cantons declared, that unless the magistrates
come to their aid, they must discontinue their functions. Confederates
of Zurich, join your efforts to ours; stifle this new
faith;<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> dismiss Zwingle and his disciples, and then let us all
unite to remedy the injuries that have been inflicted on the
popes and their courtiers."</p>

<p>Thus spoke the adversaries: and what would the citizens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
of Zurich do? Would their hearts fail them? Had their
courage cooled with the blood of their fellow-citizen?</p>

<p>Zurich did not leave her friends or enemies long in suspense.
The council announced calmly and nobly that they
could make no concessions in what concerned the Word of
God; and then proceeded to make a still more forcible reply.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ABOLITION OF PROCESSIONS AND IMAGES.</div>

<p>Ever since the year 1351, it had been customary for a
numerous procession, each member of which bore a cross, to
go on Whitmonday on a pilgrimage to Einsidlen to worship
the Virgin. This festival, which had been established in
commemoration of the battle of Tatwyll, was attended with
great disorders.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> The procession should have taken place
on the 7th of May. On the petition of the three pastors it
was prohibited by the council, and all the other processions
were reformed in their turn.</p>

<p>They did not stop here. The relics, that source of innumerable
superstitions, were honourably interred;<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> and
then, at the request of the three pastors, the council published
a decree, to the effect that honour being due to God
alone, the images should be removed from all the churches
of the canton, and their ornaments sold for the benefit of the
poor. Twelve councillors, one from each guild, the three
pastors, the city-architect, blacksmiths, carpenters, builders,
and masons, went into the various churches, and having
closed the doors,<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> took down the crosses, defaced the
frescoes, whitewashed the walls, and took away the images,
to the great delight of the believers, who regarded this proceeding
(says Bullinger) as a striking homage paid to the
true God. In some of the country churches, the ornaments
were burnt "to the honour and glory of God." Erelong
the organs were taken down, on account of their connexion
with many superstitious practices; and a baptismal service
was drawn up, from which everything unscriptural was
excluded.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>The burgomaster Roust and his colleague, with their dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
eyes joyfully hailed the triumph of the Reformation. They
had lived long enough, and they died at the very time of this
great renovation of public worship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TWO REFORMATIONS.</div>

<p>The Swiss Reformation here presents itself under an
aspect somewhat different from that of the German Reformation.
Luther had risen up against the excesses of those
who had broken the images in the churches of Wittemberg;
and in Zwingle's presence the idols fell in the temples of
Zurich. This difference is explained by the different lights
in which the two reformers viewed the same object. Luther
desired to maintain in the Church all that was not expressly
contrary to the Scriptures, and Zwingle to abolish all that
could not be proved by them. The German reformer wished
to remain united to the Church of the preceding ages, and
was content to purify it of all that was opposed to the Word
of God. The Zurich reformer passed over these ages, returned
to the apostolic times, and, carrying out an entire
transformation of the Church, endeavoured to restore it to its
primitive condition.</p>

<p>Zwingle's Reformation was therefore the more complete.
The work that Providence had confided to Luther, the restoration
of the doctrine of justification by faith, was doubtless
the great work of the Reformation; but when this was
accomplished, others remained to be done, which, although
secondary, were still important; and to these Zwingle's
exertions were more especially directed.</p>

<p>In fact, two mighty tasks had been imposed on the reformers.
Christian Catholicism, born in the midst of Jewish
pharisaism and Greek paganism, had gradually felt the influence
of these two religions, which had transformed it into
Roman-catholicism. The Reformation that was called to
purify the Church, was destined to purge it alike from the
Jewish and the pagan element.</p>

<p>The Jewish element prevailed chiefly in that part of
the christian doctrine which relates to man. Catholicism
had received from Judaism the pharisaical ideas of self-righteousness,
of salvation by human strength or works.</p>

<p>The pagan element prevailed especially in that part of the
christian doctrine which relates to God. Paganism had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
corrupted in the catholic church the idea of an infinite Deity,
whose power, being perfectly all-sufficient, is at work in all
times and in all places. It had established in the Church
the reign of symbols, images, and ceremonies; and the saints
had become the demigods of popery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER AND ZWINGLE.</div>

<p>Luther's reform was directed essentially against the Jewish
element. It was against this element that he had been compelled
to struggle, when an impudent monk on behalf of the
pope was making a trade of the salvation of souls.</p>

<p>Zwingle's reform was particularly directed against the
pagan element. It was this element with which he had
come in contact at the temple of our Lady of Einsidlen,
when a crowd, gathered together from every side, fell down
blindly before a gilded idol, as of old in the temple of the
Ephesian Diana.</p>

<p>The German reformer proclaimed the great doctrine of
justification by faith, and with it inflicted a death-blow on
the pharisaical righteousness of Rome. The reformer of
Switzerland unquestionably did the same; the inability of
man to save himself forms the basis of the work of all the
reformers. But Zwingle did something more: he established
the sovereign, universal, and exclusive agency of
God, and thus inflicted a deadly blow on the pagan worship
of Rome.</p>

<p>Roman-catholicism had exalted man and lowered God.
Luther lowered man, and Zwingle exalted God.</p>

<p>These two tasks, which were specially but not exclusively
theirs, were the complement of each other. Luther laid the
foundation of the building; Zwingle raised its crowning
stone.</p>

<p>It was reserved for a still more capacious genius to impress,
from the banks of the Leman lake, these two characters conjointly
upon the Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">OPPOSITION.</div>

<p>But while Zwingle was thus advancing with mighty
strides to the head of the confederation, the disposition of the
cantons became daily more hostile. The Zurich government
felt the necessity of relying on the people. The people,
moreover, that is to say the assembly of believers, was, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
to Zwingle's principles, the highest power to which
there could be any appeal on earth. It was resolved to test the
state of public opinion, and the bailiffs were enjoined to demand
of all the parishes whether they were ready to suffer everything
for our Lord Jesus Christ, "who," said the council, "gave
his life and his blood for us sinners."<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> The whole canton
had carefully followed the progress of the Reformation in
the city; and in many places, the cottages of the peasants
had become christian schools, wherein the Holy Scriptures
were read.</p>

<p>The proclamation of the council was read and enthusiastically
received in every parish. "Let our lords," answered
they, "remain fearlessly attached to the Word of God: we
will aid them in upholding it;<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> and if any one seeks to molest
them, we will come to their support like brave and loyal
fellow-citizens." The peasantry of Zurich showed then, that
the strength of the Church is in the christian people.</p>

<p>But the people were not alone. The man whom God had
placed at their head answered worthily to the call. Zwingle
appeared to multiply himself for the service of God. All that
were enduring persecution in the Helvetic cantons for the
cause of the Gospel addressed themselves to him.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> The responsibility
of public affairs, the care of the churches, the
anxieties of the glorious conflict that was going on in every
valley of Switzerland, weighed heavily upon the evangelist
of Zurich.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> At Wittemberg, the news of his courageous
proceedings was received with joy. Luther and Zwingle
were two great lights, placed in Upper and Lower Germany;
and the doctrine of salvation, so powerfully proclaimed
by both, filled the vast tracts that extend from the
summit of the Alps to the shores of the Baltic and of the
North Sea.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">New Opposition&mdash;Abduction of &OElig;xlin&mdash;The Family of the Wirths&mdash;The
Populace at the Convent of Ittingen&mdash;The Diet of Zug&mdash;The Wirths
apprehended and given up to the Diet&mdash;Their Condemnation.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">NEW OPPOSITION.</div>

<p>The Word of God could not thus invade extensive countries,
without its triumphs exasperating the pope in his palace, the
priest in his presbytery, and the Swiss magistrates in their
councils. Their terror increased from day to day. The people
had been consulted; the christian people became of consequence
in the Christian Church, and appeals were made to
their sympathy and faith and not to the decrees of the Roman
chancery! So formidable an attack required a still more formidable
resistance. On the 18th of April, the pope addressed
a brief to the confederates, and the diet, which met at Zug in
the month of July, yielding to the urgent exhortations of the
pontiff, sent a deputation to Zurich, Schaffhausen, and Appenzel,
commissioned to acquaint these states with the firm resolve
of the diet to crush the new doctrine, and to prosecute
its adherents to the forfeiture of their goods, their honours,
and even of their lives. Zurich did not hear this warning
without emotion; but a firm reply was made, that, in matters
of faith, the Word of God alone must be obeyed. On
receiving this answer, Lucerne, Schwytz, Uri, Unterwalden,
Friburg, and Zug, trembled with rage; and, unmindful of the
reputation and strength the accession of Zurich had formerly
given to the infant confederation, forgetting the precedence
that had been immediately accorded to her, the simple and
solemn oaths that had been made to her, and of the many
victories and reverses they had shared with her,&mdash;these states
declared that they would no longer sit in diet with Zurich.
Thus in Switzerland, as in Germany, the partisans of Rome
were the first to break the federal unity. But threats and
the rupture of alliances were not enough. The fanaticism of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the cantons called for blood; and it was soon seen with what
arms Rome intended combating the Word of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A PATRIARCHAL FAMILY.</div>

<p>One of Zwingle's friends, the worthy &OElig;xlin,<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> was pastor
of Burg upon the Rhine, in the neighbourhood of Stein.
The bailiff Am-Berg, who had appeared to listen to the
Gospel with delight,<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> being desirous of obtaining that bailiwick,
had promised the leading men of Schwytz to root out
the new faith. &OElig;xlin, although not within his jurisdiction,
was the first upon whom he exercised his severity.</p>

<p>About midnight, on the 7th of July 1524, some persons
knocked at the pastor's door; they were the bailiff's soldiers,
who entered the house, seized &OElig;xlin, and carried him away
prisoner, in defiance of his cries. Thinking they meant
to assassinate him, he cried "Murder;" the inhabitants
started from their beds in affright, and the village soon became
the scene of a frightful tumult, which was heard as far
as Stein. The sentinel on guard at the castle of Hohenklingen
fired the alarm-gun; the tocsin was rung, and the
inhabitants of Stein, Stammheim, and the adjoining places,
were soon moving, and inquiring of one another in the darkness
what was the matter.</p>

<p>At Stammheim lived the deputy-bailiff Wirth, whose two
eldest sons, Adrian and John, both young priests full of
piety and courage, were preaching the Gospel with great
unction. John especially abounded in faith, and was ready
to sacrifice his life for his Saviour. This was truly a patriarchal
family. Hannah, the mother, who had borne the
bailiff many children, and brought them up in the fear of
the Lord, was revered for her virtues throughout the whole
district. At the noise of the tumult in Burg, the father
and the two eldest sons went out like their neighbours.
The father was indignant that the bailiff of Frauenfeld
should have exercised his authority in a manner contrary to
the laws of the country. The sons learned with sorrow that
their brother, their friend, the man whose good example they
were delighted to follow, had been dragged away like a criminal.
Each of them seized a halberd, and in spite of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
fears of a tender wife and mother, the father and his two
sons joined the band of citizens of Stein with the determination
of rescuing their pastor. Unhappily, a number of those miscreants
who make their appearance in every disorder had joined
the expedition; they pursued the bailiff's officers; the latter,
hearing the tocsin and the shouts of alarm, redoubled their
speed, dragging their victim after them, and soon placed the
river Thur between themselves and their pursuers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MOB IN THE CONVENT OF ITTINGEN.</div>

<p>When the people of Stein and Stammheim reached the
bank of the river, and found no means of crossing, they
halted, and resolved to send a deputation to Frauenfeld.
"Oh!" said the bailiff Wirth, "the pastor of Stein is so
dear to us, that for his sake I would willingly sacrifice my
goods, my liberty, and my life."<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> The populace, finding
themselves near the Carthusian convent of Ittingen, whose
inmates were believed to have encouraged the tyranny of the
bailiff Am-Berg, entered the building and took possession
of the refectory. These miserable wretches soon became intoxicated,
and shameful disorders were the consequence.
Wirth vainly entreated them to leave the convent;<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> he was
in danger of being maltreated by them. His son Adrian
remained outside the cloister. John entered, but soon came
out again, distressed at what he had seen.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> The drunken
peasants proceeded to ransack the wine-cellars and the store-rooms,
to break the furniture, and burn the books.</p>

<p>When the news of these disorders reached Zurich, some
deputies from the council hastened to the spot, and ordered
all persons under the jurisdiction of the canton to return
to their homes. They did so immediately. But a body of
Thurgovians, attracted by the disturbance, established themselves
in the convent, for the sake of its good cheer. On a
sudden a fire broke out, no one knew how, and the monastery
was burnt to the ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DIET AT ZUG.</div>

<p>Five days after this, the deputies of the cantons met at
Zug. Nothing was heard in the assembly but threats of
vengeance and of death. "Let us march with banners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
flying on Stein and Stammheim," said they, "and put the
inhabitants to the sword." The deputy-bailiff and his two
sons had long been objects of especial dislike on account of
their faith. "If any one is guilty," said the deputy of
Zurich, "he must be punished, but according to the laws of
justice, and not by violence." Vadian, deputy of St. Gall,
supported this opinion. Upon this the avoyer John Hug of
Lucerne, unable to contain himself any longer, exclaimed
with frightful imprecations:<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> "The heretic Zwingle is the
father of all these insurrections; and you too, doctor of St.
Gall, are favourable to his infamous cause, and aid him in
securing its triumphs......You ought no longer to have a
seat among us." The deputy of Zug endeavoured to restore
peace, but in vain. Vadian left the hall, and as the
populace had designs upon his life, he quitted the town secretly,
and reached the convent of Cappel by a circuitous
route.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WIRTHS SURRENDERED TO THE DIET.</div>

<p>Zurich, intent on suppressing every disorder, resolved to
apprehend provisionally those persons who were marked out
by the rage of the confederates. Wirth and his two sons
were living quietly at Stammheim. "Never will the enemies
of God be able to vanquish His friends," said Adrian
Wirth from the pulpit. The father was warned of the fate
impending over him, and was entreated to flee with his two
sons. "No," answered he; "I will wait for the officers,
putting my trust in God." And when the soldiers made
their appearance at his house, he said: "My lords of Zurich
might have spared themselves all this trouble: if they had only
sent a child I should have obeyed their summons."<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> The
three Wirths were taken to Zurich and put in prison. Rutiman,
bailiff of Nussbaum, shared their fate. They were
strictly examined, but nothing reprehensible was found in their
conduct.</p>

<p>As soon as the deputies of the cantons had heard of the
imprisonment of these four citizens, they required them to
be sent to Baden, and ordered that in case of refusal their
troops should march upon Zurich and carry them off by force.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
"To Zurich belongs the right of ascertaining whether these
men are guilty or not," said the deputies of that state; "and
we have found no fault in them." On this the deputies of
the cantons exclaimed: "Will you surrender them to us?
Answer yes or no, and not a word more." Two deputies of
Zurich mounted their horses, and rode off with all haste to
their constituents.</p>

<p>On their arrival, the whole town was in agitation. If the
prisoners were refused, the confederates would come and seek
them with an armed force; to give them up was consenting
to their death. Opinions were divided: Zwingle declared for
their refusal. "Zurich," said he, "ought to remain faithful
to its constitution." At last it was supposed a middle course
had been found. "We will deliver the prisoners into your
hands," said they to the diet, "but on condition that you
will examine them solely with regard to the affair of Ittingen,
and not on their faith." The diet acceded to this proposition,
and on the Friday before St. Bartholomew's day (18th August
1524) the three Wirths and their friend, accompanied by four
councillors of state and several armed men, quitted Zurich.</p>

<p>A deep concern was felt by all the city at the prospect of
the fate which awaited the two youths and their aged companions.
Sobbing alone was heard as they passed along.
"Alas!" exclaims a contemporary, "what a mournful procession!"<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
The churches were all filled. "God will punish
us!" cried Zwingle. "Let us at least pray him to impart his
grace to these poor prisoners, and to strengthen them in the
faith."<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">EXAMINATION AND TORTURE.</div>

<p>On Friday evening the accused arrived at Baden, where
an immense crowd was waiting for them. At first they were
taken to an inn, and thence to prison. They could scarcely
advance, the crowd so pressed around to catch a sight
of them. The father, who walked in front, turned towards
his two sons, and observed to them meekly: "See, my dear
children, we are (as the apostle says) men appointed to death;
for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
to men" (1 Cor. iv. 9). Then, as he saw among the crowd
his deadly enemy, Am-Berg, the cause of all his misfortunes,
he went up to him and held out his hand, although the
bailiff would have turned away: "There is a God in heaven
who knows all things," said he calmly, as he grasped his
adversary's hand.</p>

<p>The examination began on the following day: the bailiff
Wirth was first brought in. He was put to the torture,
without any regard to his character or his age; but he persisted
in declaring his innocence of the pillage and burning
of Ittingen. He was then accused of having destroyed an
image representing St. Anne. Nothing could be substantiated
against the other prisoners, except that Adrian Wirth was
married, and preached after the manner of Zwingle and
Luther; and that John Wirth had given the sacrament to a
sick man without bell and taper.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p>But the more apparent their innocence, the greater was
the fury of their adversaries. From morning until noon
they inflicted the cruelest tortures on the old man. His tears
could not soften his judges. John Wirth was treated with still
greater barbarity. "Tell us," they asked him in the midst of
his anguish, "whence did you learn this heretical faith? From
Zwingle or from any other person?" And when he exclaimed,
"O merciful and everlasting God, help and comfort me!"
"Where is your Christ now?" said one of the deputies. When
Adrian appeared, Sebastian of Stein, the Bernese deputy, said
to him: "Young man, tell us the truth; for if you refuse to
do so, I swear by the knighthood that I gained on the very
spot where the Lord suffered martyrdom, that we will open
your veins one after another." They then fastened the young
man to a rope, and hoisted him into the air: "There, my little
master," said Stein with a devilish sneer, "there is your
wedding present;"<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> alluding to the marriage of this youthful
servant of the Lord.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONDEMNATION.</div>

<p>When the examination was ended, the deputies returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
to their cantons to deliver their report, and did not meet
again till four weeks after. The bailiff's wife, the mother of
the two priests, repaired to Baden, carrying an infant child
in her arms, to intercede with the judges. John Escher of
Zurich accompanied her as her advocate. Among the judges
he saw Jerome Stocker, landamman of Zug, who had been
twice bailiff of Frauenfeld: "Landamman!" said he, "you
know the bailiff Wirth; you know that he has always been
an upright man."&mdash;"You say the truth, my dear Escher,"
replied Stocker, "he has never injured anybody; fellow-citizens
and strangers were always kindly welcomed to his
table; his house was a convent, an inn, and an hospital;<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>
and so, if he had committed robbery or murder, I would have
made every exertion to obtain his pardon. But seeing that
he has burnt Saint Anne, Christ's grandmother, he must
die!"&mdash;"The Lord have mercy upon us," exclaimed Escher.</p>

<p>The gates were now shut: it was the 28th September, and
the deputies of Berne, Lucerne, Uri, Schwytz, Unterwalden,
Zug, Glaris, Friburg, and Soleure, having proceeded to deliberate
on their judgment with closed doors, as was customary,
passed sentence of death on the bailiff Wirth, on his son
John, who was the firmest in his faith, and who appeared to
have led away the others, and on the bailiff Rutiman.
Adrian, the second son, was granted to his mother's tears.</p>

<p>The officers proceeded to the tower to fetch the prisoners.
"My son," said the father to Adrian, "never avenge our
death, although we have not deserved punishment." Adrian
burst into tears. "Brother," said John, "the cross of Christ
must always follow his Word."<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">EXECUTION.</div>

<p>After the sentence was read, the three Christians were led
back to prison; John Wirth walking first, the two vice-bailiffs
next, and a priest behind them. As they were crossing
the castle bridge, on which was a chapel dedicated to St.
Joseph, the priest called out to the two old men, "Fall down
and call upon the saints." John Wirth, who was in front,
turned round at these words and said, "Father, be firm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
You know that there is only one Mediator between God and
man, the Lord Jesus Christ."&mdash;"Assuredly, my son," replied
the old man, "and by the help of His grace I will continue
faithful even to the end." Upon this they all three began to
repeat the Lord's Prayer, "Our Father which art in heaven,"
and so crossed the bridge.</p>

<p>They were next conducted to the scaffold. John Wirth,
whose heart was filled with the tenderest anxiety for his
parent, bade him farewell. "My dearly beloved father,"
said he, "henceforward thou art no longer my father, and I
am no longer thy son, but we are brothers in Christ our
Lord, for whose name we must suffer death.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> To-day, if it
be God's pleasure, my beloved brother, we shall go to Him
who is the Father of us all. Fear nothing." "Amen!" replied
the old man, "and may God Almighty bless thee, my
beloved son and brother in Christ!"</p>

<p>Thus, on the threshold of eternity, did father and son take
leave of each other, hailing the new mansions in which they
should be united by everlasting ties. The greater part of
those around them shed floods of tears.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> The bailiff Rutiman
prayed in silence.</p>

<p>All three then knelt down "in Christ's name," and their
heads rolled upon the scaffold.</p>

<p>The crowd, observing the marks of torture upon their
bodies, gave loud utterance to their grief. The two bailiffs
left twenty-two children, and forty-five grandchildren. Hannah
was obliged to pay twelve golden crowns to the executioner
who had deprived her husband and her son of life.</p>

<p>Thus blood, innocent blood, had been shed. Switzerland
and the Reformation were baptized with the blood of the
martyrs. The great enemy of the Gospel had done his
work; but in doing it, his power was broken. The death of
the Wirths was to accelerate the triumphs of the Reformation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Abolition of the Mass&mdash;Zwingle's Dream&mdash;Celebration of the Lord's Supper&mdash;Fraternal
Charity&mdash;Original Sin&mdash;The Oligarchs opposed to the
Reform&mdash;Various Attacks.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">ABOLITION OF THE MASS.</div>

<p>It was not thought desirable to proceed to the abolition of
the mass in Zurich immediately after the suppression of
images; but now the proper moment seemed to have arrived.</p>

<p>Not only had the light of the Gospel been diffused
among the people; but the violence of the blows struck by
the enemy called upon the friends of God to reply to them
by some impressive demonstration of their unalterable fidelity.
Every time that Rome erects a scaffold, and that
heads fall upon it, the Reformation will exalt the holy Word
of the Lord, and throw down some abuses. When Hottinger
was executed, Zurich suppressed images; and now that
the heads of the Wirths have rolled on the ground, Zurich
will reply by the abolition of the mass. The more Rome
increases her cruelties, the more will the Reformation increase
in strength.</p>

<p>On the 11th of April 1525, the three pastors of Zurich,
accompanied by Megander and Oswald Myconius, appeared
before the Great Council, and demanded the re-establishment
of the Lord's Supper. Their language was solemn;<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>
all minds were absorbed in meditation; every man felt the importance
of the resolution which the council was called upon
to take. The mass, that mystery which for more than three
centuries had been the very soul of the religious service of
the Latin Church, was to be abolished, the corporeal presence
of Christ to be declared an illusion, and the illusion itself
removed from the minds of the people. Courage was needed
to arrive at such a resolution, and there were men in the
council who shuddered at this daring thought. Joachim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Am-Grütt, under-secretary of state, alarmed at the bold demand
of the pastors, opposed it with all his might. "These
words, <i>This is my body</i>," said he, "unquestionably prove
that the bread is the body of Christ himself." Zwingle
observed that &#949;&#963;&#964;&#953; (is) is the proper word in the Greek
language to express <i>signifies</i>, and he quoted several instances
in which this word is employed in a figurative
sense. The Great Council were convinced and did not hesitate;
the Gospel doctrines had penetrated their hearts;
besides, as they were separating from the Church of Rome,
there was a certain satisfaction in making that separation
as complete as possible, and in digging a gulf between it
and the Reformation. The council, therefore, ordered the
mass to be suppressed, and decreed that on the next day,
Holy Thursday, the Lord's Supper should be celebrated in
conformity with the apostolical usages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S DREAM.</div>

<p>Zwingle was seriously engrossed by these thoughts, and
when he closed his eyes at night, was still seeking for
arguments with which to oppose his adversaries. The
subjects that had so strongly occupied his mind during the
day presented themselves before him in a dream. He
fancied that he was disputing with Am-Grütt, and that he
could not reply to his principal objection. Suddenly a
figure stood before him and said: "Why do you not quote
the 11th verse of the 12th chapter of Exodus: <i>Ye shall eat
it</i> (the lamb) <i>in haste</i>: <i>it is the Lord's passover</i>?" Zwingle
awoke, sprung out of bed, took up the Septuagint translation,
and there found the same word &#949;&#963;&#964;&#953; (is), which all are
agreed is synonymous with <i>signifies</i> in this passage.</p>

<p>Here then, in the institution of the paschal feast under the
old covenant, is the very meaning that Zwingle defends.
How can he avoid concluding that the two passages are
parallel?</p>

<p>On the following day Zwingle preached a sermon on
this text, and spoke so forcibly that he removed every
doubt.</p>

<p>This circumstance, which admits of so simple an explanation,
and the very expression Zwingle employs to show that
he could not recall the appearance of the figure he had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
in his dream,<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> have given rise to the assertion that Zwingle
received this doctrine from the devil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CELEBRATION OF THE LORD'S SUPPER.</div>

<p>The altars had disappeared; plain tables bearing the
sacramental bread and wine were substituted in their place,
and an attentive crowd pressed round them. There was
something particularly solemn in this multitude. On Holy
Thursday, the young people,&mdash;on Friday, the day of the Passion,
the adult men and women,&mdash;and on Easter Sunday, the
aged, celebrated in turn the death of the Lord.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p>The deacons read aloud the passages of Scripture that
relate to this sacrament; the pastors addressed the flock in
an earnest exhortation, calling upon all to retire from this
sacred feast who, by persevering in their sin, would pollute
the body of Jesus Christ. The people knelt down, the bread
was carried round on large platters or wooden plates, and
each one broke off a morsel; the wine was next distributed
in wooden goblets: in this manner it was thought they
made a nearer approach to the simplicity of the primitive
Supper. Emotions of surprise or joy filled every heart.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>Thus was the Reform carried on in Zurich. The simple
celebration of the Lord's Supper appeared to have shed
anew over the Church the love of God and of the brethren.
The words of Jesus Christ were once more spirit and life.
While the different orders and parties in the Church of Rome
were incessantly disputing among themselves, the first effect
of the Gospel was to restore charity among the brethren.
The love of the first ages was then revived in Christendom.
Enemies were seen renouncing their long-cherished and inveterate
enmities, and embracing one another after having
partaken of the sacramental bread. Zwingle, delighted at
these affecting manifestations, returned thanks to God that
the Lord's Supper was again working those miracles of
charity which the sacrifice of the mass had long ceased to
accomplish.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BROTHERLY LOVE&mdash;ORIGINAL SIN.</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>
<p>"Peace dwells in our city," exclaimed he; "among us there
is no fraud, no dissension, no envying, no strife. Whence
can proceed such harmony except from the Lord, and that
the doctrine we preach inclines us to innocence and peace?"<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>Charity and unity then prevailed, although there was no
uniformity. Zwingle in his <i>Commentary on True and False
Religion</i>,<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> which he dedicated to Francis I. in March 1525,
the year of the battle of Pavia, had put forward some truths
in the manner best calculated to procure their reception by
human reason, following in this respect the example of
several of the most distinguished scholastic divines. In this
way he had given the name of <i>disease</i> to our original corruption,
and reserved the appellation of <i>sin</i> for the actual
transgression of the law.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> But these statements, which
called forth some objections, did not however interrupt
brotherly love; for Zwingle, even when he persisted in calling
original sin a disease, added, that all men were lost by
this disease, and that Jesus Christ was the only remedy.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>
In this position there is no error of Pelagianism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VARIOUS ATTACKS.</div>

<p>But while the celebration of the Lord's Supper at Zurich
was attended by a return to Christian brotherhood, Zwingle
and his friends had to support a severer struggle against
their adversaries from without. Zwingle was not only a
christian teacher, he was also a true patriot; and we know
how zealously he contended against the foreign capitulations,
pensions, and alliances. He felt convinced that these
external influences must tend to destroy piety, blind the
reason, and scatter discord on every side. But his bold protests
were destined to prejudice the advancement of the
Reformation. In almost every canton, the chiefs who received
the pensions of the foreigner, and the officers who
led the youth of Helvetia to battle, formed powerful factions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
formidable oligarchies, that attacked the Reformation, not so
much on behalf of the Church as on account of the injury it
would inflict on their interests and honours. They had
already gained the victory in Schwytz; and that canton,
where Zwingle, Leo Juda, and Oswald Myconius had
taught, and which seemed as if it would walk in the footsteps
of Zurich, had suddenly reverted to the mercenary
capitulations, and shut its gates against the Reformation.</p>

<p>Even in Zurich, some wretches, instigated by foreign
intrigues, attacked Zwingle during the night, flung stones at
his house, broke the windows, and called with loud cries for
"the red haired Uli, the vulture of Glaris;" so that Zwingle
awoke from his sleep and ran to his sword.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> This action is
very characteristic of the man.</p>

<p>But these isolated attacks could not paralyze the movement
by which Zurich was carried onward, and which was
beginning to shake all Switzerland. They were pebbles
thrown into a torrent to check its course. Everywhere its
waters were swelling, threatening to sweep away the most
formidable obstacles.</p>

<p>The Bernese having informed the people of Zurich that
several states had refused to sit with them in future in the
diet: "Well, then," replied these men of Zurich with calmness,
and raising their hands towards heaven, as the heroes
of Rutli in old time, "we have the firm assurance that God,
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in whose name the confederation
was formed, will not desert us, and will at last, of
his great mercy, make us sit at the right hand of his
sovereign majesty."<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> Possessing such faith the Reformation
had nothing to fear. But would it gain similar victories
in the other states of the confederation? Would not
Zurich remain alone on the side of God's Word? Would
Berne, Basle, and other cantons remain subject to the power
of Rome? This we shall soon see. Let us therefore turn
towards Berne, and study the progress of the Reformation
in the most influential state of the confederation.</p>

Monastery of Königsfeldt&mdash;Margaret Watteville to Zwingle&mdash;The

<div class="sidenote">BERNE&mdash;THE WATTEVILLES.</div>

<p>Nowhere was the struggle likely to be so severe as at
Berne, for there the Gospel counted both powerful friends and
formidable adversaries. At the head of the reforming party
were the banneret John Weingarten, Bartholomew May,
member of the Smaller Council, his sons Wolfgang and
Claudius, his grandsons James and Benedict, and above all,
the family of the Wattevilles. The avoyer James Watteville,
who since 1512 had occupied the first station in the
republic, had early read the writings of Luther and Zwingle,
and had often conversed about the Gospel with John Haller,
pastor of Anseltingen, whom he had protected against his
persecutors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ADVERSE PARTY AT BERNE.</div>

<p>His son Nicholas, then thirty-one years of age, had been
for two years provost of the church of Berne, and as such,
by virtue of the papal ordinances, enjoyed great privileges;
accordingly Berthold Haller used to call him "our bishop."<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>
The prelates and the pope spared no endeavours to bind
him to the interests of Rome;<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> and it seemed as if everything
would keep him from a knowledge of the Gospel; but
the ways of God are more powerful than the flatteries of
man. Watteville was turned from darkness to the mild
light of the Gospel, says Zwingle.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> As a friend of Berthold
Haller, he read all the letters which the latter received from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Zwingle, and could not find language to express his admiration.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>

<p>The influence of the two Wattevilles, one of whom was at
the head of the state and the other of the church, would
apparently draw after it the whole republic. But the opposite
party was not less powerful.</p>

<p>Amongst its leaders were the schulthess of Erlach, the
banneret Willading, and many patricians whose interests
were identical with those of the convents under their administration.
Behind these influential men were an ignorant
and corrupted clergy, who called the evangelical doctrine
"an invention of hell"&mdash;"My dear confederates," said the
councillor Mullinen before a full assembly in the month of
July, "take care that this Reformation does not come here;
at Zurich a man is not safe in his own house, and he is
obliged to have a guard to protect him." Accordingly they
invited to Berne the reader of the Dominicans of Mentz,
one John Hein, who went into the pulpit and declaimed
against the Reformation with the eloquence of a Saint
Thomas.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>Thus were the two parties drawn up in battle-array
against each other; a struggle seemed inevitable, and already
the result did not appear doubtful. In fact, one
common faith united a part of the people to the most distinguished
families of the state. Berthold Haller exclaimed,
full of confidence in the future: "Unless God's anger be
turned against us, it is not possible for the Word of God
to be banished from this city, for the Bernese are hungering
after it!"<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRST SUCCESSES OF THE REFORM.</div>

<p>Shortly after this two acts of the government appeared
to incline the balance to the side of the Reformation. The
Bishop of Lausanne having announced an episcopal visitation,
the council intimated to him through the provost Watteville,
that he had better refrain from so doing.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> And at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the same time the councils of Berne issued an ordinance which,
whilst in appearance it conceded something to the enemies
of the Reformation, sanctioned the principles of the new
doctrines. They decreed that the Gospel and the doctrine
of God, as it is laid down by the books of the Old and New
Testament, should be preached exclusively, freely, and openly;
and that the ministers should abstain from every doctrine,
discussion, or writing, proceeding from Luther or other
teachers.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> Great was the surprise of the adversaries of the
Reformation when they saw the evangelical preachers boldly
appealing to this ordinance. This decree, which was the
basis of all those that succeeded, was the legal commencement
of the Reformation in Berne. From that time the
progress of this canton was more decided, and Zwingle, whose
attentive eyes watched everything that was passing in
Switzerland, was able to write to the provost Watteville:
"All Christians are overjoyed, on account of the faith which
the pious city of Berne has just received."<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>&mdash;"The cause is
the cause of Christ," exclaimed the friends of the Gospel;<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>
and they devoted themselves to it with an increase of
courage.</p>

<p>The enemies of the Reformation, alarmed at these first
advantages, closed their ranks, and resolved to strike a blow
that would secure their victory. They conceived the project
of getting rid of these ministers whose bold discourses
were overthrowing the most time-honoured customs; and it
was not long before a favourable opportunity occurred.
There existed in Berne, on the spot now occupied by the hospital
of the Island, a convent of nuns of St. Dominic, consecrated
to St. Michael. The anniversary of the archangel (29th
September) was a great festival at the monastery. Many
of the clergy were present this year, and among others Wittenbach
of Bienne, Sebastian Meyer, and Berthold Haller.
Having entered into conversation with the nuns, among
whom was Clara, daughter of Claudius May, a supporter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
of the Reformation, Haller said to her, in the presence of
her grandmother: "The merits of the conventual life are
imaginary, whilst marriage is an honourable state, instituted
by God himself." Some of the nuns to whom Clara repeated
Berthold's words were horrified at them. "Haller maintains,"
was the rumour in the city, "that all nuns are
children of the devil." The opportunity which the enemies
of the Reformation were looking for was found. Going
before the Smaller Council, they referred to an ancient
law which enacted that whoever carried off a nun from
her convent should lose his head, but asked for a mitigation
of the penalty, and that, without giving the three ministers
a hearing, they should be banished for life. The Smaller
Council acceded to their prayer, and the matter was immediately
carried before the Great Council.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HALLER AT THE CONVENT&mdash;ACCUSED AND ACQUITTED.</div>

<p>Thus was Berne about to be deprived of her reformers:
the intrigues of the papal party were successful. But Rome,
who triumphed when she addressed herself to the oligarchs,
was beaten before the people or their representatives.
Scarcely had they heard the names of Haller, Meyer, and
Wittembach, men whom all Switzerland venerated, than
an energetic opposition was manifested by the Great Council
against the Smaller Council and the clergy. "We cannot
condemn the accused unheard," exclaimed Tillmann; "their
testimony is surely as good as that of a few women." The
ministers were called before them: the affair was embarrassing.
At length John Weingarten said: "Let us give credit to both
parties." They did so: the ministers were discharged, with
an intimation to confine themselves to their pulpits, and not
to meddle with the cloisters. But the pulpit was sufficient
for them. The efforts of their adversaries had redounded to
their own disgrace. It was a great victory for the Reformation.
Accordingly one of the patricians exclaimed: "It is
all over now: Luther's affair must go forward."<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CONVENT OF KÖNIGSFELDT.</div>

<p>And it did in fact go forward, and in the very places
where they expected it the least. At Königsfeldt, on the
Aar, near the castle of Hapsburg, stood a monastery adorned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
with all the conventual magnificence of the Middle Ages,
and where reposed the ashes of several members of that
illustrious house which had given so many emperors to
Germany. Here the daughters of the greatest families of
Switzerland and Swabia used to take the veil. It was not
far from the spot where, on the 1st of May 1308, the Emperor
Albert had fallen by the hand of his nephew John of Swabia;
and the beautiful painted windows of the church of Königsfeldt
represented the horrible punishments that had been
inflicted on the relations and vassals of the murderer.
Catherine of Waldburg-Truchsess, abbess of the convent at
the period of the Reformation, numbered among her nuns
Beatrice of Landenberg, sister to the Bishop of Constance,
Agnes of Mullinen, Catherine of Bonstetten, and Margaret
of Watteville, the provost's sister. The liberty enjoyed in
this convent, which in former times had given room for
scandalous disorders, now permitted the Holy Scriptures with
the writings of Zwingle and Luther to be introduced; and
soon a new life entirely changed its aspect. Near that cell
to which Queen Agnes, Albert's daughter, had retired, after
having bathed in torrents of blood as in "maydew," and
where, plying the distaff or embroidering ornaments for the
church, she had mingled exercises of devotion with thoughts
of vengeance,&mdash;Margaret Watteville had only thoughts of
peace, and divided her time between reading the Scriptures
and compounding salutary ingredients to form an excellent
electuary. Retiring to her cell, this youthful nun had the
boldness to write to the doctor of Switzerland. Her letter
displays to us, better than any reflections could do, the
christian spirit that existed in those pious women, who are
still so grievously calumniated even in our own days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARGARET WATTEVILLE TO ZWINGLE.</div>

<blockquote><p>"May grace and peace in the Lord Jesus be given and
multiplied towards you always by God our heavenly
Father," wrote the nun of Königsfeldt to Zwingle. "Most
learned, reverend, and dear Sir, I entreat you to take in
good part the letter I now address to you. The love which
is in Christ constrains me to do so, especially since I have
learnt that the doctrine of salvation is spreading day by day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
through your preaching of the Word of God. For this
reason I give praise to the everlasting God for enlightening
us anew, and sending us by his Holy Spirit so many heralds
of His blessed Word; and at the same time I offer up my
ardent prayers that he will clothe with his strength both you
and all those who proclaim His glad tidings, and that, arming
you against all the enemies of the truth, He will cause
his Divine Word to grow in all men. Very learned Sir, I
venture to send your reverence this trifling mark of my
affection; do not despise it; it is an offering of christian
charity. If this electuary does you good, and you should
desire more, pray let me know; for it would be a great
pleasure to me to do anything that was agreeable to you;
and it is not I only who think thus, but all those who love
the Gospel in our convent of Königsfeldt. They salute your
reverence in Jesus Christ, and we all commend you without
ceasing to His almighty protection.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>"Saturday before <i>Lætare</i>, 1523."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was the pious letter that the nun of Königsfeldt wrote
to the doctor of Switzerland.</p>

<p>A convent into which the light of the Gospel had thus
penetrated could not persevere in the observances of a monastic
life. Margaret Watteville and her sisters, convinced
that they could better serve God in the bosom of their
families than in the cloister, asked permission to leave it.
The council of Berne in alarm endeavoured at first to bring
these nuns to reason, and the provincial and abbess employed
threats and promises by turns; but the sisters Margaret,
Agnes, Catherine, and their friends were not to be
shaken. Upon this the discipline of the convent was relaxed,
the nuns were exempted from fasting and matins, and their
allowance was increased. "It is not the liberty of the flesh
that we require," said they to the council; "it is that of the
spirit. We, your poor and innocent prisoners, entreat you
to have pity on us!"&mdash;"<i>Our</i> prisoners! <i>our</i> prisoners!" exclaimed
the banneret Krauchthaler, "they shall be no prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
of mine!" This language from one of the firmest
supporters of the convents decided the council; the convent
gates were opened, and shortly after, Catherine Bonstetten
was married to William of Diesbach.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TWO CHAMPIONS.</div>

<p>And yet Berne, far from siding openly with the reformers,
held a middle course, and endeavoured to pursue a see-saw
system. An opportunity soon occurred for showing this
vacillating procedure. Sebastian Meyer, reader of the Franciscans,
published a retractation of his Romish errors, which
created a great sensation, and in which, describing a conventual
life, he said: "In the convents the monks live more
impurely, fall more frequently, recover themselves more
tardily, walk more unsteadily, rest more dangerously, are
pitied more rarely, are cleansed more slowly, die more despairingly,
and are condemned more severely."<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> At the
very time Meyer was thus denouncing the cloisters, John
Heim, reader of the Dominicans, was exclaiming from the
pulpit: "No! Christ has not, as the evangelists teach, made
satisfaction to his Father once for all. It is further necessary
that God should every day be reconciled to man by
the sacrifice of the mass and by good works." Two citizens
who chanced to be present, interrupted him by saying: "It
is not true." There was immediately a great disturbance in
the church; Heim remained silent; many persons urged
him to continue, but he left the pulpit without finishing his
sermon. On the morrow, the Great Council struck a blow
at once against Rome and the Reformation; they turned the
two great controversialists, Meyer and Heim, out of the
city. "They are neither muddy nor clear,"<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> it was said of the

Berne. It was advancing on every side. The sisters of the

Clara May and several of her friends, anxiously pondering
on what they ought to do, wrote to the learned Henry Bullinger.
"St. Paul," replied he, "enjoins young women
not to make vows, but to marry, and not to live in idleness
under a false show of piety. (1 Timothy v. 13, 14.) Follow

and sin. Her father Bartholomew, who had spent fifty
years on the battle-field or in the council-chamber, heard
of his daughter's resolution with delight. Clara left the
convent.</p>

<p>The provost Nicholas Watteville, whose whole interest
bound him to the Roman hierarchy, and who was to be
raised to the first vacant bishopric in Switzerland, also renounced
his titles, his revenues, and his expectations, that
he might preserve an unspotted conscience; and snapping
all the bonds by which the popes had endeavoured to entangle
him, he entered into the marriage state, established
by God from the creation of the world. Nicholas Watteville
married Clara May; and about the same time, her sister
Margaret, the nun of Königsfeldt, was united to Lucius

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Basle&mdash;&OElig;colampadius&mdash;He visits Augsburg&mdash;Enters a Convent&mdash;Retires
to Sickingen's Castle&mdash;Returns to Basle&mdash;Ulrich Hütten&mdash;His
Plans&mdash;Last Effort of Chivalry&mdash;Hütten dies at Ufnau.</p></blockquote>


<p>Thus everything announced the triumphs that the Reformation
would soon obtain at Berne. Basle, a city of no less
importance, and which was then the Athens of Switzerland,
was also arming herself for the great combat that has
distinguished the sixteenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">&OElig;COLAMPADIUS.</div>

<p>Each of the cities of the confederation had its peculiar
character. Berne was the city of the great families, and it
seemed that the question would be decided by the part adopted
by certain of the leading men. At Zurich, the ministers of
the Word,&mdash;Zwingle, Leo Juda, Myconius, and Schmidt,&mdash;carried
with them a powerful class of citizens. Lucerne was
the city of arms and military capitulations; Basle, of learning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and the printing-press. Here Erasmus, the head of the
literary republic in the sixteenth century, had taken up his
abode; and preferring the liberty he enjoyed in this capital to
the flattering invitations of popes and kings, he had become
the centre of a numerous concourse of men of letters.</p>

<p>But an humble, meek, and pious man, though in genius far
inferior to Erasmus, was destined erelong to exercise in this
very city a more powerful influence than that of the prince
of the schools. Christopher of Utenheim, bishop of Basle,
in concert with Erasmus, was endeavouring to surround himself
with men fitted to accomplish a kind of half-way Reformation.
With this view he had invited Capito and &OElig;colampadius
to his court. In the latter person there was a taint
of monasticism that often annoyed the illustrious philosopher.
But &OElig;colampadius soon became enthusiastically attached to
him; and perhaps would have lost all independence in this
close intimacy, if Providence had not separated him from his
idol. In 1517, he returned to Weinsberg, his native place,
where he was soon disgusted with the disorders and profane
jests of the priests. He has left us a noble monument of the
serious spirit which then animated him, in his celebrated
work on <i>The Easter Revels</i>, which appears to have been
written about that time.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">&OElig;COLAMPADIUS IN THE CONVENT.</div>

<p>Having been invited to Augsburg about the end of 1518,
as cathedral preacher, he found that city still agitated by the
famous conference held there in the month of May between
Luther and the papal legate. He had to decide between
one party and the other; &OElig;colampadius did not hesitate,
and declared in favour of the reformer. This frankness
soon gave rise to a violent opposition against him; and
feeling convinced that his timidity and the weakness of his
voice would be prejudicial to his success in the world, he
looked around him, and fixed his eyes on a convent of
monks of Saint Bridget, near Augsburg, celebrated for their
piety and their profound and liberal studies. Feeling the
need of repose, of leisure, of study, and of prayer, he turned
towards these friars, and inquired: "Can I live among you
according to the Word of God?" The latter having replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
in the affirmative, &OElig;colampadius entered the monastery on
the 23d of April 1520, with the express condition that he
should be free, if ever the service of God's Word should call
him elsewhere.</p>

<p>It was well that the future reformer of Basle should, like
Luther, become acquainted with that monastic life which is
the highest expression of Roman-catholicism. But here he
found no repose; his friends blamed the step; and he himself
openly declared that Luther was nearer the truth than
his adversaries. Accordingly, Eck and the other Romish
doctors pursued him with their menaces, even in his calm
retreat.</p>

<p>At this time &OElig;colampadius was neither reformed nor a
follower of Rome; he desired a certain purified catholicism,
which is nowhere to be found in history, but the idea of
which has often bridged the way to many minds. He began
to correct the rules of his order in conformity with the Word
of God. "Do not, I beseech you," said he to his brethren,
"set a higher value upon your statutes than on the ordinances
of God!"&mdash;"We desire no other law," replied the
brothers, "than that of our Saviour. Take our books, and
mark, as if in the presence of Christ himself, whatever you
find contrary to His Word." &OElig;colampadius applied himself
to the task, but was almost wearied by the labour. "O
Almighty God!" exclaimed he, "what abominations has not
Rome approved of in these statutes!"</p>

<p>As soon as he pointed out some of them, the anger of the
monks was aroused. "Heretic!" exclaimed they, "apostate!
you deserve to be thrown into a dungeon for the rest
of your days!" They excluded him from public prayers. But
the danger from without was still greater. Eck and his party
had not relinquished their projects. "In three days," he
was told, "they will be here to arrest you." He went to the
brethren and said, "Will you give me up to assassins?"
The monks were silent and undetermined; they neither
wished to save nor to destroy him. At this moment some
friends of &OElig;colampadius arrived near the cloister with horses
to carry him to a place of safety. On being informed of this,
the monks resolved to allow the departure of a brother who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
had brought trouble into their convent. "Farewell," said
he, and was free. He had remained nearly two years in
the cloister of Saint Bridget.</p>

<p>&OElig;colampadius was saved; at last he began to breathe.
"I have sacrificed the monk," wrote he to a friend, "and
have regained the Christian." But his flight from the convent
and his heretical writings were known everywhere, and
everywhere people shrunk back at his approach. He knew
not what would become of him, when, in the spring of 1522,
Sickingen offered him an asylum, which he accepted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">&OElig;COLAMPADIUS AT EBERNBURG AND BASLE.</div>

<p>His mind, oppressed by monastic servitude, took a new
flight in the midst of the noble warriors of Ebernburg.
"Christ is our liberty," exclaimed he, "and death, which men
consider their greatest misfortune, is a real gain to us." He
directly began reading the Gospels and Epistles in German
to the people. "As soon as these trumpets sound," said he,
"the walls of Jericho will fall down."</p>

<p>Thus, in a fortress on the banks of the Rhine, and in the
midst of illiterate warriors, the most humble man of his age
was preparing for that change of worship which Christianity
was shortly to undergo. But Ebernburg was too confined
for him, and he felt the need of other society than these
armed men. The bookseller Cratander invited him to Basle;
Sickingen allowed him to depart, and &OElig;colampadius, delighted
at the thought of seeing his old friends again, arrived
in that city on the 16th of November 1522. After having
lived there some time, simply as a man of learning without any
public occupation, he was nominated curate of Saint Martin's
church, and it was this call to an humble and obscure employment<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>
that possibly decided the Reformation of Basle.
An immense crowd filled the church whenever &OElig;colampadius
went into the pulpit.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> At the same time the public
lectures delivered by himself and Pellican were crowned
with such success that even Erasmus was forced to exclaim,
"&OElig;colampadius triumphs."<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">SUCCESS AND ALARM&mdash;HUTTEN.</div>

<p>In effect, this mild yet firm man (says Zwingle) spread
around him the sweet savour of Christ, and all those who
crowded about him grew in truth.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> Often, indeed, a rumour
was circulated that he would be forced to leave Basle and
recommence his perilous pilgrimage. His friends, Zwingle
in particular, were alarmed; but erelong the tidings of fresh
victories gained by &OElig;colampadius scattered their fears and
raised their hopes. The renown of his lectures extended
even to Wittemberg, and delighted Luther, who talked with
Melancthon about him every day. And yet the Saxon reformer
was not without anxiety. Erasmus was at Basle,
and Erasmus was the friend of &OElig;colampadius......Luther
thought it his duty to put the man whom he loved on his
guard. "I much fear," wrote he, "that Erasmus, like
Moses, will die in the country of Moab, and never lead us
into the land of promise."<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<p>Erasmus had taken refuge at Basle, as in a quiet city,
lying in the centre of the literary movement, and from the
bosom of which he could, by means of the press of Frobenius,
act upon France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and England.
But did not like men to come and trouble him there; and
if he looked upon &OElig;colampadius with suspicion, another
man inspired him with still greater apprehension. Ulrich
Hütten had followed &OElig;colampadius to Basle. For a long
while he had been attacking the pope, as one knight engages
with another. "The axe," said he, "is already laid at the
root of the tree. Germans! faint not in the heat of the battle;
the die is cast; the work is begun......Liberty for ever!"
He had abandoned Latin, and now wrote only in German;
for it was the people he wished to address.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAST EFFORT OF CHIVALRY.</div>

<p>His views were noble and generous. It was his idea
that there should be an annual meeting of the bishops to
regulate the interests of the Church. A christian constitution,
and above all a christian spirit, was to go forth from
Germany, as from Judea in other times, and spread through
the whole world. Charles V. was to be the youthful hero
appointed to realize this golden age; but Hütten, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
seen the failure of his hopes in this quarter, had turned
towards Sickingen, and sought from knighthood what the
empire had refused him. Sickingen, at the head of the
feudal nobility, had played a distinguished part in Germany;
but the princes had besieged him in his castle of Landstein,
and the new invention of cannons had crushed those aged
walls, accustomed to other attacks.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> The taking of Landstein
had proved the final defeat of chivalry,&mdash;the decisive
victory of artillery over shields and lances,&mdash;the triumph of
modern times over the middle ages. Thus the last exploit
of the knights was destined to be in favour of the Reformation;
the first effort of these new arms and system of warfare
was to be against it. The mailed warriors that fell beneath
the unlooked for storm of balls, and lay among the ruins of
Landstein, gave way to other soldiers. Other conflicts were
about to begin; a spiritual chivalry succeeded to that of the
Du Guesclins and Bayards. And those old and ruined
battlements, those battered walls, these dying heroes, proclaimed
with greater energy than even Luther could have
done, that not by such allies or such arms would the Gospel
of the Prince of peace obtain the victory.</p>

<p>The fall of Landstein and of chivalry had blasted all
Hütten's hopes. Standing beside the corpse of Sickingen,
he bade farewell to those brighter days which his imagination
had conjured up before him, and losing all confidence in
man, he sought only for seclusion and repose. In search of
these he visited Erasmus in Switzerland. These two men
had long been friends; but the unpolished and turbulent
knight, braving the opinions of others, ever ready to lay his
hand upon the sword, dealing his blows right and left on all
whom he met, could scarcely live in harmony with the
squeamish and timid Dutchman, with his refined manners, his
mild and polished language, his love of approbation, and his
readiness to sacrifice everything for its sake, and fearing
nothing in the world so much as a dispute. On arriving at
Basle, Hütten, poor, sick, and a fugitive, immediately inquired
for his old friend. But Erasmus trembled at the
thought of receiving at his table a person under the ban of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the pope and the emperor, who would spare no one, who
would borrow money of him, and would no doubt be dragging
after him a crowd of those "Gospellers" whom Erasmus
dreaded more and more.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> He refused to see him, and
shortly after, the magistrates of Basle desired Hütten to
leave the city. Wounded to the quick, and exasperated
against his timid friend, Hütten repaired to Mulhausen, and
there published a violent pamphlet against Erasmus, to
which the latter replied in a paper overflowing with wit.
The knight had grasped his sword with both hands, and
aimed a crushing blow at his antagonist; the scholar,
adroitly stepping aside, pecked the soldier smartly in return.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF HUTTEN.</div>

<p>Hütten was again compelled to flee; he reached Zurich,
and there met with a generous reception from the noble-hearted
Zwingle. But intrigues again compelled him to
leave that city; and after passing some time at the baths of
Pfeffers, he repaired with a letter from the Swiss reformer to
the pastor John Schnepp, who inhabited the small island
of Ufnau in the lake of Zurich. This poor minister entertained
the sick and fugitive knight with the most touching
charity. It was in this peaceful and obscure retreat that
Ulrich Hütten, one of the most remarkable men of the sixteenth
century, died obscurely about the end of August 1523,
after a most agitated life, expelled by one party, persecuted by
another, deserted by nearly all, and having always contended
against superstition, but, as it would seem, without having
ever possessed the truth. The poor pastor, who had some
skill in the healing art, had vainly lavished on him all his
cares. With him chivalry expired. He left neither money,
nor furniture, nor books;&mdash;nothing in the world but a pen.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>
Thus was broken the arm of iron that had presumed to support
the ark of God.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Erasmus and Luther&mdash;Vacillations of Erasmus&mdash;Luther to Erasmus&mdash;Erasmus's
Treatise against Luther on Free Will&mdash;Three Opinions&mdash;Effect
upon Luther&mdash;Luther on Free Will&mdash;The Jansenists and the
Reformers&mdash;Homage to Erasmus&mdash;His Anger&mdash;The Three Days.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">ERASMUS AND LUTHER.</div>

<p>There was in Germany a man more formidable to Erasmus
than the ill-fated Hütten: this was Luther. The moment
had now arrived when these two great champions of the age
were to measure their strength hand to hand. The two
reformations at which they arrived were very different.
While Luther desired a thorough reform, Erasmus, a friend
to half-measures, was endeavouring to obtain concessions
from the hierarchy that would unite the extreme parties.
The vacillations and inconsistency of Erasmus disgusted
Luther. "You desire to walk upon eggs without crushing
them," said the latter, "and among glasses without breaking
them."<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>At the same time he met the vacillations of Erasmus with
absolute decision. "We Christians," said he, "ought to be
sure of our doctrine, and able to say <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i> without hesitation.
To presume to hinder us from affirming our belief
with full conviction, is depriving us of faith itself. The Holy
Ghost is no sceptic;<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> and He has written in our hearts a
firm and strong assurance, which makes us as certain of our
faith as we are of life itself."</p>

<p>These words alone suffice to show us on which side strength
was to be found. To accomplish a religious transformation,
there is need of a firm and living faith. A salutary revolution
in the Church will never proceed from philosophical
views and mere human opinions. To fertilize the earth after
a long drought, the lightning must cleave the cloud and the
windows of heaven must be opened. Criticism, philosophy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
and even history may prepare the way for the true faith,
but cannot supply its place. In vain would you clear
the water-courses and repair the dikes, so long as the rain
does not come down from heaven. All human learning
without faith is but an aqueduct without water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WITTICISM OF ERASMUS.</div>

<p>Whatever might have been the essential difference between
Luther and Erasmus, the friends of Luther, and even the
reformer himself, had long hoped to see Erasmus unite with
them against Rome. Many sayings which his caustic humour
let fall were quoted, as showing his disagreement with the
most zealous defenders of Romanism. One day, for instance,
when he was in England, he had a keen discussion with
Thomas More on transubstantiation: "Believe that you
have the body of Christ," said the latter, "and you have
it really." Erasmus made no reply. Shortly after, when
leaving England, More lent him a horse to carry him to
the seaside; but Erasmus took it with him to the Continent.
As soon as More was informed of this, he wrote
very severely to him about it. Erasmus, by way of reply,
sent him these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You said of the bodily presence of Christ:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Believe that you have, and you have him!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the nag that I took my reply is the same:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Believe that you have, and you have him!"<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was not only in England and Germany that Erasmus
had thus become known. It was said at Paris that Luther
had only opened the door, after Erasmus had picked the
lock.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p>The position taken by Erasmus was by no means easy:
"I shall not be unfaithful to the cause of Christ," wrote he
to Zwingle, "at least so far as the age will permit me."<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>
In proportion as he beheld Rome rising up against the friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
of the Reformation, he prudently retreated. He was applied
to from all quarters; the pope, the emperor, kings, princes,
scholars, and even his most intimate friends, entreated him
to write against the reformer.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> "No work," wrote the pope,
"can be more acceptable to God, and worthier of yourself
and of your genius."<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p>Erasmus long resisted these solicitations; he could not
conceal from himself that the cause of the reformers was the
cause of religion as well as of letters. Besides, Luther was
an adversary with whom every one feared to try his strength,
and Erasmus already imagined he felt the quick and vigorous
blows of the Wittemberg champion. "It is very easy to
say, Write against Luther," replied he to a Romish theologian;
"but it is a matter full of peril."<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> Thus he would&mdash;and
yet he would not.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER TO ERASMUS.</div>

<p>This irresolution on the part of Erasmus drew on him the
attacks of the most violent men of both parties. Luther
himself knew not how to reconcile the respect he felt for
Erasmus's learning with the indignation he felt at his timidity.
Resolving to free himself from so painful a dilemma,
he wrote him a letter in April 1524, which he intrusted to
Camerarius. "You have not yet received from the Lord,"
said Luther, "the courage necessary to walk with us against
the papists. We put up with your weakness. If learning
flourishes: if by its means the treasures of Scripture are
opened to all; this is a gift which God has bestowed on us
through you; a noble gift, and for which our thanksgivings
ascend to heaven! But do not forsake the task that has
been imposed upon you, and pass over to our camp. No
doubt your eloquence and genius might be very useful to us;
but since you are wanting in courage, remain where you
are. I could wish that our people would allow your old age
to fall asleep peacefully in the Lord. The greatness of our
cause has long since gone beyond your strength. But on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the other hand, my dear Erasmus, refrain from scattering over
us with such profusion that pungent salt which you know so
well how to conceal under the flowers of rhetoric; for it is
more dangerous to be slightly wounded by Erasmus than to
be ground to powder by all the papists put together. Be
satisfied to remain a spectator of our tragedy;<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> and publish
no books against me; and for my part, I will write none
against you."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ERASMUS DETERMINES TO ATTACK LUTHER.</div>

<p>Thus did Luther, the man of strife, ask for peace; it was
Erasmus, the man of peace, who began the conflict.</p>

<p>Erasmus received this communication from the reformer
as the bitterest of insults; and if he had not yet determined
to write against Luther, he probably did so then. "It
is possible," he replied, "that Erasmus by writing against
you will be of more service to the Gospel than certain dunces
who write for you,<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> and who do not permit him to be a simple
spectator of this tragedy."</p>

<p>But he had other motives besides.</p>

<p>Henry VIII. of England, and the nobility of that kingdom,
earnestly pressed him to declare himself openly against
the Reformation. Erasmus, in a moment of courage, suffered
the promise to be wrung from him. His equivocal
position had become a source of constant trouble to him; he
loved repose, and the necessity he felt of continually justifying
his conduct disturbed his existence; he was fond of glory,
and already men were accusing him of fearing Luther, and of
being too weak to answer him; he was accustomed to the
highest seat, and the little monk of Wittemberg had dethroned
the mighty philosopher of Rotterdam. He must
then, by some bold step, recover the position he had lost.
All Christendom that adhered to the old worship implored
him to do so. A capacious genius and the greatest reputation
of the age were wanted to oppose the Reformation.
Erasmus answered the call.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S SENTIMENTS.</div>

<p>But what weapons will he employ? Will he hurl the
thunders of the Vatican? Will he defend the abuses that

great movement that agitated men's minds after the lethargy
of so many centuries filled him with joy, and he would have
feared to trammel it. Unable to be the champion of Romanism
in what it has added to Christianity, he undertook
to defend it in what it had taken away. In attacking Luther,
Erasmus selected the point where Romanism is lost in
Rationalism,&mdash;the doctrine of free will, or the natural power of
man. Thus, while undertaking the defence of the Church,
Erasmus gratified the men of the world, and while battling
for the popes, he contended also on behalf of the philosophers.
It has been said that he had injudiciously confined himself
to an obscure and unprofitable question.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> Luther, the reformers,
and their age, judged very differently; and we agree
with them. "I must acknowledge," said Luther, "that in
this controversy you are the only man that has gone to the
root of the matter. I thank you for it with all my heart;
for I would rather be occupied with this subject than with
all these secondary questions about the pope, purgatory, and
indulgences, with which the enemies of the Gospel have
hitherto pestered me."<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>His own experience and an attentive study of the Holy
Scriptures, and of St. Augustine, had convinced Luther that
the natural powers of man are so inclined to evil, that he
cannot, of himself, reach any farther than a certain outward
rectitude, altogether insufficient in the eyes of the Deity.
He had at the same time recognised that it was God who
gives true righteousness, by carrying on freely the work of
faith in man by his Holy Spirit. This doctrine had become
the mainspring of his religion, the predominant idea in his theology,
and the point on which the whole Reformation turned.</p>

<p>While Luther maintained that every good thing in man
came down from God, Erasmus sided with those who thought
that this good proceeded from man himself. God or man,&mdash;good
or evil,&mdash;these are certainly no paltry questions; and
if "trivialities" exist, they must be looked for elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ERASMUS ON FREE WILL.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>It was in the autumn of 1524 that Erasmus published his
famous treatise entitled <i>Dissertation on the Freedom of the
Will</i>; and it had no sooner appeared, than the philosopher
could hardly believe his own boldness. With eyes fixed on the
arena, he looked tremblingly at the gauntlet he had flung to
his adversary. "The die is cast," wrote he with emotion to
Henry VIII.; "the book on <i>free will</i> has appeared.&mdash;Trust
me, this is a daring act. I expect I shall be stoned for it.&mdash;But
I console myself by the example of your majesty, whom
the rage of these people has not spared."<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p>His alarm soon increased to such a degree that he bitterly
regretted the step he had taken. "Why was I not permitted
to grow old in the garden of the Muses?" exclaimed he.
"Here am I, at sixty, driven into the arena, and holding
the cestus and the net of the gladiator, instead of the lyre!&mdash;I
am aware," wrote he to the Bishop of Rochester, "that in
writing upon free will, I have gone beyond my sphere......You
congratulate me upon my triumphs! Ah! I know not
that I triumph. The faction (<i>i.e.</i> the Reformation) is spreading
daily.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> Was it then fated, that at my time of life I
should be transformed from a friend of the Muses into a
wretched gladiator!"</p>

<p>It was no doubt an important matter for the timid Erasmus
to have risen up against Luther; he was, however,
far from showing any very great boldness. In his book he
seems to ascribe but little to man's will, and to leave the
greater portion to Divine grace; but at the same time he
chose his arguments in a manner to make it be believed that
man does everything, and God nothing. Not daring openly
to express his thoughts, he affirms one thing and proves another;
and hence we may be allowed to suppose that he
believed what he proved and not what he affirmed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THREE OPINIONS&mdash;EFFECT ON LUTHER.</div>

<p>He distinguishes three several opinions, opposed in three
different degrees to Pelagianism. "Some think," said he,
"that man can neither will, nor commence, and still less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
perform, any good work, without the special and continual
aid of Divine grace; and this opinion seems probable
enough. Others teach that man's will is powerless except
for evil, and that it is grace alone which works in us any
good; and finally, there are some who assert that there has
never been any free will either in angels, or in Adam, or
in us, either before or after grace, but that God works in
man both good and evil, and that everything happens from
an absolute necessity."<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<p>Erasmus, while seeming to admit the former of these
opinions, makes use of arguments that confute it, and
which the most decided Pelagian might employ. In this
manner, quoting the passages of Scripture in which God
offers man the choice between good and evil, he adds:
"Man must therefore have the power to will and to choose;
for it would be ridiculous to say to any one, Choose! when it
was not in his power to do so."</p>

<p>Luther did not fear Erasmus. "Truth," said he, "is
mightier than eloquence. The victory remains with him
who lisps out the truth, and not with him who puts
forth a lie in flowing language."<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> But when he received
Erasmus's treatise in the month of October 1524, he found
it so weak that he hesitated to reply to it. "What! so
much eloquence in so bad a cause!" said he; "it is as if a
man were to serve up mud and dung on dishes of silver and
gold.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> One cannot lay hold of you. You are like an eel
that slips through the fingers; or like the fabulous Proteus
who changed his form in the very arms of those who wished
to grasp him."</p>

<p>But as Luther did not reply, the monks and scholastic
divines began to utter shouts of victory: "Well, where is
your Luther now? Where is the great Maccabeus? Let
him come down into the lists! let him come forth! Ah, ah!
he has met with his match at last! He has learnt now to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
remain in the back-ground; he has found out how to hold
his tongue."<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S REPLY.</div>

<p>Luther saw that he must write an answer; but it was
not until the end of the year 1525 that he prepared to do so;
and Melancthon having informed Erasmus that Luther
would be moderate, the philosopher was greatly alarmed.
"If I have written with moderation," said he, "it is my
disposition; but Luther possesses the wrath of Peleus' son
(Achilles). And how can it be otherwise? When a vessel
braves a storm such as that which has burst upon Luther,
what anchor, what ballast, what helm does it not require
to prevent it from being driven out of its course! If
therefore he replies to me in a manner not in accordance
with his character, these sycophants will cry out that we are
in collusion."<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> We shall see that Erasmus was soon relieved
of this apprehension.</p>

<p>The doctrine of God's election as the sole cause of man's
salvation had always been dear to the reformer; but hitherto
he had considered it in a practical light only. In his reply
to Erasmus, he investigated it particularly in a speculative
point of view, and endeavoured to establish by such arguments
as appeared to him most conclusive, that God works
everything in man's conversion, and that our hearts are
so alienated from the love of God that they cannot have a
sincere desire for righteousness, except by the regenerating
influence of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>"To call our will a free will," said he, "is to imitate
those princes who accumulate long titles, styling themselves
lords of sundry kingdoms, principalities, and distant islands
(of Rhodes, Cyprus, and Jerusalem, &amp;c.), while they have
not the least power over them." Here, however, Luther
makes an important distinction, clearly showing that he by
no means participated in the third opinion that Erasmus
had pointed out and imputed to him. "Man's will may be
called a free will, not in relation to that which is above
him, that is to say, to God; but with respect to that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
is below, that is, to the things of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> As regards
my property, my fields, my house, my farm, I can act, do,
and manage freely. But in the things of salvation, man is
a captive; he is subjected to the will of God, or rather of
the devil.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> Show me but one of all these advocates of free
will (he exclaims) that has found in himself sufficient
strength to endure a trifling injury, a fit of anger, or merely
a look from his enemy, and bear it with joy; then&mdash;without
even asking him to be ready to give up his body, his life,
his wealth, his honour, and all things&mdash;I acknowledge you
have gained your cause."<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">POWER OF MAN AND OF GOD.</div>

<p>Luther's glance was too penetrating not to discover the
contradictions into which his opponent had fallen. And
accordingly, in his reply he endeavours to fasten the philosopher
in the net in which he had entangled himself. "If
the passages you quote," said he, "establish that it is easy
for us to do good, why do we dispute? What need have
we of Christ and of the Holy Ghost? Christ would then
have acted foolishly in shedding his blood to acquire for us
a power that we already possessed by nature." In truth,
the passages cited by Erasmus must be taken in quite a different
sense. This much debated question is clearer than it
appears to be at first sight. When the Bible says to man,
Choose, it presupposes the assistance of God's grace, by which
alone he can do what it commands. God, in giving the commandment,
also gives the strength to fulfil it. If Christ said
to Lazarus, Come forth, it was not that Lazarus had power
to restore himself; but that Christ, by commanding him to
leave the sepulchre, gave him also the strength to do so,
and accompanied His words with His creative power. He
spoke, and it was done. Moreover, it is very true that the
man to whom God speaks must will; it is he who wills, and
not another; he can receive this will but from God alone;
but it is in him that this will must be, and the very commandment
that God addresses to him, and which, according
to Erasmus, establishes the ability of man, is so reconcilable
with the workings of God, that it is precisely by these means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
that the working is effected. It is by saying to the man
"Be converted," that God converts him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S SECOND AND THIRD PARTS.</div>

<p>But the idea on which Luther principally dwelt in his
reply is, that the passages quoted by Erasmus are intended
to teach men their duty, and their inability to perform it,
but in no way to make known to them the pretended power
ascribed to them. "How frequently it happens," says
Luther, "a father calls his feeble child to him, and says:
'Will you come, my son! come then, come!' in order that
the child may learn to call for his assistance, and allow himself
to be carried."<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>After combating Erasmus's arguments in favour of free
will, Luther defends his own against the attacks of his opponent.
"Dear Dissertation," says he ironically, "mighty
heroine, who pridest thyself in having overthrown these
words of our Lord in St. John: <i>Without me ye can do</i> <small>NOTHING</small>,
which thou regardest nevertheless as the prop of my
argument, and callest it <i>Luther's Achilles</i>, listen to me.
Unless thou canst prove that this word <i>nothing</i>, not only
may but must signify <i>little</i>, all thy high-sounding phrases,
thy splendid examples, have no more effect than if a man
were to attempt to quench an immense fire with a handful
of straw. What are such assertions as these to us: <i>This
may mean; that may be understood</i>......whilst it was thy
duty to show us that it must be so understood......Unless
thou doest so, we take this declaration in its literal meaning,
and laugh at all thy examples, thy great preparations,
and thy pompous triumphs."<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<p>Finally, in a concluding part, Luther shows, and always
from Scripture, that the grace of God does everything.
"In short," says he at the end, "since Scripture everywhere
contrasts Christ with that which has not the spirit of Christ;
since it declares that all which is not Christ and in Christ is
under the power of error, darkness, the devil, death, sin, and
the wrath of God, it follows that all these passages of the
Bible that speak of Christ are opposed to free will. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
such passages are numberless; the Holy Scriptures are full
of them."<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE JANSENISTS AND THE REFORMERS.</div>

<p>We perceive that the discussion which arose between Luther
and Erasmus is the same as that which a century after took
place between the Jansenists and Jesuits, between Pascal
and Molina.<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> How is it that, while the results of the Reformation
were so immense, Jansenism, though adorned by
the noblest geniuses, wasted and died away? It is because
Jansenism went back to Augustine and relied on the
Fathers; while the Reformation went back to the Bible
and leant upon the Word of God. It is because Jansenism
entered into a compromise with Rome, and wished to establish
a middle course between truth and error, while the
Reformation, relying upon God alone, cleared the soil, swept
away all the rubbish of past ages, and laid bare the primitive
rock. To stop half way is a useless work; in all things
we should persevere to the end. Accordingly, while Jansenism
has passed away, the destinies of the world are bound
up with evangelical Christianity.</p>

<p>Further, after having keenly refuted error, Luther paid
a brilliant but perhaps a somewhat sarcastic homage to
Erasmus himself. "I confess," said he, "that you are a
great man; where have we ever met with more learning,
intelligence, or ability, both in speaking and writing? As
for me, I possess nothing of the kind; there is only one
thing from which I can derive any glory,&mdash;I am a Christian.
May God raise you infinitely above me in the knowledge of
the Gospel, so that you may surpass me as much in this respect
as you do already in every other."<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p>Erasmus was beside himself when he read Luther's reply;
and would see nothing in his encomiums but the honey of a
poisoned cup, or the embrace of a serpent at the moment he
darts his envenomed sting. He immediately wrote to the
Elector of Saxony, demanding justice; and Luther having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
desired to appease him, he lost his usual temper, and, in the
words of one of his most zealous apologists, began "to pour
forth invectives with a broken voice and hoary hair."<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></p>

<p>Erasmus was vanquished. Hitherto, moderation had been
his strength,&mdash;and he had lost it. Passion was his only
weapon against Luther's energy. The wise man was wanting
in wisdom. He replied publicly in his <i>Hyperaspistes</i>,
accusing the reformer of barbarism, lying, and blasphemy.
The philosopher even ventured on prophesying. "I prophesy,"
said he, "that no name under the sun will be held
in greater execration than Luther's." The jubilee of 1817
has replied to this prophecy, after a lapse of three hundred
years, by the enthusiasm and acclamations of the whole Protestant
world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE THREE DAYS.</div>

<p>Thus, while Luther with the Bible was setting himself at
the head of his age, Erasmus, standing up against him,
wished to occupy the same place with philosophy. Which
of these two leaders has been followed? Both undoubtedly.
Nevertheless Luther's influence on the nations of Christendom
has been infinitely greater than that of Erasmus. Even
those who did not thoroughly understand the grounds of the
dispute, seeing the conviction of one antagonist and the
doubts of the other, could not refrain from believing that
the first was right and the second wrong. It has been said
that the three last centuries, the sixteenth, the seventeenth,
and the eighteenth, may be conceived as an immense battle
of three days' duration.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> We willingly adopt this beautiful
comparison, but not the part that is assigned to each of
the days. The same struggle has been ascribed to the
sixteenth and to the eighteenth century. On the first day,
as on the last, it is philosophy that breaks the ranks. The
sixteenth century philosophical!......Strange error! No:
each of these days has its marked and distinct character.
On the first day of the conflict, it was the Word of God, the
Gospel of Christ, that triumphed; and then Rome was
defeated, as well as human philosophy, in the person of
Erasmus and her other representatives. On the second day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
we grant that Rome, her authority, her discipline, her doctrine,
reappeared and were about to triumph by the intrigues
of a celebrated society and the power of the scaffold, aided
by men of noble character and sublime genius. On the
third day, human philosophy arose in all its pride, and finding
on the field of battle, not the Gospel, but Rome, made
short work, and soon carried every intrenchment. The first
day was the battle of God, the second the battle of the priest,
the third the battle of reason. What will be the fourth?......In
our opinion, the confused strife, the deadly contest
of all these powers together, to end in the victory of Him to
whom triumph belongs.</p>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">The Three Adversaries&mdash;Source of Truth&mdash;Grebel&mdash;The Fanatics and

<div class="sidenote">THE THREE ADVERSARIES.</div>

<p>But the battle fought by the Reformation in the great day
of the sixteenth century, under the standard of the Word of
God, was not one and single, but manifold. The Reformation
had many enemies to contend with at once; and after having
first protested against the decretals and the supremacy of the
pope, and then against the cold apophthegms of the rationalists,
philosophers, or schoolmen, it had equally to struggle
with the reveries of enthusiasm and the hallucinations of
mysticism; opposing alike to these three powers the shield
and the sword of Divine revelation.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that there is a great similarity, a
striking unity, between these three powerful adversaries.
The false systems that in every age have been the most
opposed to evangelical Christianity, have always been distinguished
by their making religious knowledge proceed
from within the man himself. Rationalism makes it proceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
from reason; mysticism from certain inner lights; and
Romanism from an illumination of the pope. These three
errors look for truth in man: evangelical Christianity looks
for it wholly in God; and while mysticism, rationalism, and
Romanism, admit a permanent inspiration in certain of our
fellow-men, and thus open a door to every extravagance and
diversity, evangelical Christianity recognises this inspiration
solely in the writings of the apostles and prophets, and alone
presents that great, beautiful, and living unity which is ever
the same in all ages.</p>

<p>The task of the Reformation has been to re-establish the
rights of the Word of God, in opposition not only to Romanism,
but also to mysticism and rationalism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GREBEL AND THE FANATICS.</div>

<p>The fanaticism, which had been extinguished in Germany
by Luther's return to Wittemberg, reappeared in full
vigour in Switzerland, and threatened the edifice that
Zwingle, Haller, and &OElig;colampadius had built on the Word
of God. Thomas Munzer, having been forced to quit Saxony
in 1521, had reached the frontiers of Switzerland. Conrad
Grebel, whose restless and ardent disposition we have already
noticed,<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> had become connected with him, as had also Felix
Manz, a canon's son, and several other Zurichers; and Grebel
had immediately endeavoured to gain over Zwingle. In
vain had the latter gone farther than Luther; he saw a party
springing up which desired to proceed farther still. "Let
us form a community of true believers," said Grebel to him;
"for to them alone the promise belongs, and let us found a
church in which there shall be no sin."<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>&mdash;"We cannot make
a heaven upon earth," replied Zwingle; "and Christ has
taught us that we must let the tares grow up along with the
wheat."<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH.</div>

<p>Grebel having failed with the reformer, would have desired
to appeal to the people. "The whole community of Zurich,"
said he, "ought to have the final decision in matters of
faith." But Zwingle feared the influence these radical enthusiasts
might exercise over a large assembly. He thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
that, except on extraordinary occasions when the people
might be called upon to express their accordance, it was
better to confide the interests of religion to a college, which
might be considered the chosen representatives of the
Church. Accordingly the Council of Two Hundred, which
exercised the supreme political authority in Zurich, was
also intrusted with the ecclesiastical power, on the express
condition that they should conform in all things to the Holy
Scriptures. No doubt it would have been better to have
thoroughly organized the Church, and called on it to appoint
its own representatives, who should be intrusted solely
with the religious interests of the people; for a man may
be very capable of administering the interests of the State,
and yet very unskilful in those of the Church; just as the
reverse of this is true also. Nevertheless the inconvenience
was not then so serious as it would have been in
these days, since the members of the Great Council had
frankly entered into the religious movement. But, however
this may be, Zwingle, while appealing to the Church,
was careful not to make it too prominent, and preferred
the representative system to the actual sovereignty of the
people. This is what, after three centuries, the states of
Europe have been doing in the political world for the last
fifty years.</p>

<p>Being rejected by Zwingle, Grebel turned to another
quarter. Rubli, formerly pastor at Basle, Brödtlein, pastor
at Zollikon, and Louis Herzer, received him with eagerness.
They resolved to form an independent congregation
in the midst of the great congregation, a Church within the
Church. The baptism of adult believers only, was to be
their means of assembling their congregation. "Infant
baptism," said they, "is a horrible abomination, a flagrant
impiety, invented by the wicked spirit, and by Nicholas II.,
pope of Rome."<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

<p>The council of Zurich was alarmed, and ordered a public
discussion to be held; and as they still refused to abjure
their opinions, some of the Zurichers among their number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
were thrown into prison, and several foreigners were banished.
But persecution only inflamed their zeal: "Not
by words alone," cried they, "but with our blood, we are
ready to bear testimony to the truth of our cause." Some
of them, girding themselves with cords or ozier twigs, ran
through the streets, exclaiming: "Yet a few days, and
Zurich will be destroyed! Woe to thee, Zurich! Woe!
woe!" The simple-minded and pious were agitated and
alarmed. Fourteen men, among whom was Felix Mantz,
and seven women, were apprehended, in despite of Zwingle's
intercession, and put on bread and water in the heretic's
tower. After being confined a fortnight, they managed
to loosen some planks in the night, and aiding one another,
effected their escape. "An angel," said they, "had opened
the prison and led them forth."<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PROPHET BLAUROCK.</div>

<p>A monk, who had escaped from his convent, George Jacob
of Coire, surnamed Blaurock, as it would seem, from the
blue dress he constantly wore, joined their sect, and from
his eloquence was denominated <i>a second Paul</i>. This daring
monk travelled from place to place, constraining many, by
his imposing fervour, to receive his baptism. One Sunday,
when at Zollikon, the impetuous monk interrupted the deacon
as he was preaching, calling out in a voice of thunder:
"It is written, <i>My house is a house of prayer, but ye have
made it a den of thieves</i>." Then raising the staff he carried
in his hand, he struck four violent blows.</p>

<p>"I am a door," exclaimed he; "whosoever entereth by
me shall find pasture. I am a good shepherd. My body I
give to the prison; my life I give to the sword, the stake,
or the wheel. I am the beginning of the baptism and of
the bread of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p>While Zwingle was opposing this torrent in Zurich, Saint
Gall was soon inundated with it. Grebel arrived there, and
was received by the brethren with acclamations; and on
Palm Sunday he proceeded to the banks of the Sitter with
a great number of his adherents, whom he there baptized.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE TO THE PEOPLE OF ST. GALL.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>The news quickly spread through the adjoining cantons,
and a great crowd flocked from Zurich, Appenzel, and several
other places to the "Little Jerusalem."</p>

<p>Zwingle's heart was wrung at the sight of this agitation.
He saw a storm bursting on these districts where the seed of
the Gospel was just beginning to spring up.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> Resolving to
oppose these sentiments on baptism,<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> he wrote a treatise on
that subject,<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> which the council of St. Gall, to whom it was
addressed, ordered to be read in the church before all the
people.</p>

<p>"My dear brethren in the Lord," said Zwingle, "the
water of the torrents that issue from our rocks carries with
it everything within its reach. At first it is only small
stones; but these dash violently against larger ones, until
at last the torrent becomes so strong that it carries away all
it meets, and leaves in its track wailing and vain regrets,
and fertile meadows changed into a wilderness. The spirit
of strife and self-righteousness acts in a similar manner: it
excites discord, destroys charity, and where it found beautiful
and flourishing churches, leaves behind it nothing but
flocks plunged into mourning and desolation."</p>

<p>Thus spoke Zwingle, the child of the Tockenburg mountains.
"Give us the Word of God," exclaimed one who
was present in the church; "and not the word of Zwingle."
Immediately confused voices were heard: "Away with the
book! away with the book!" shouted the multitude. After
this they rose and quitted the church, crying out: "You
may keep the doctrine of Zwingle; as for us, we will keep
the Word of God."<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<p>The fanaticism now broke forth into the most lamentable
disorders. Maintaining that the Lord had exhorted
us to become like children, these unhappy creatures began
to clap their hands, and skip about in the streets, to dance
in a ring, sit on the ground, and tumble each other about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
in the dust. Some burnt the New Testament, saying:
"The letter killeth, the Spirit giveth life." Others, falling
into convulsions, pretended to have revelations from the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOHN SCHUCKER AND SONS.</div>

<p>In a solitary house on the Müllegg near St. Gall, lived an
aged farmer, John Schucker, with his five sons. They
had all of them, including the domestics, received the new
religion; and two of the sons, Thomas and Leonard, were
distinguished for their fanaticism. On Shrove Tuesday
(7th February 1526), they invited a large party to their
house, and their father killed a calf for the feast. The
viands, the wine, and this numerous assembly, heated their
imaginations; the whole night was passed in fanatical
conversation and gesticulations, convulsions, visions, and
revelations.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>In the morning, Thomas, still agitated by this night of
disorder, and having, as it would seem, lost his reason, took
the calf's bladder, and placing in it part of the gall, intending
thus to imitate the symbolical language of the prophets,
approached his brother Leonard, saying with a gloomy voice:
"Thus bitter is the death thou art to suffer!" He then
added: "Brother Leonard, kneel down!" Leonard fell on
his knees; shortly after, "Brother Leonard, arise!" Leonard
stood up. The father, brothers, and others of the company
looked on with astonishment, asking themselves what
God would do. Thomas soon resumed: "Leonard, kneel
down again!" He did so. The spectators, alarmed at the
gloomy countenance of the wretched man, said to him:
"Think of what you are about, and take care that no mischief
happens."&mdash;"Fear not," replied Thomas, "nothing
will happen but the will of the Father." At the same time
he hastily caught up a sword, and striking a violent blow at
his brother, kneeling before him as a criminal before the
executioner, he cut off his head, exclaiming: "Now the
will of the Father is accomplished." All the bystanders
recoiled with horror at the deed; and the farm resounded
with groans and lamentations. Thomas, who had nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
on but a shirt and trousers, rushed barefooted and bareheaded
out of the house, ran to St. Gall with frenzied gestures,
entered the house of the burgomaster Joachim Vadian,
and said to him with haggard looks and wild cries: "I proclaim
to thee the day of the Lord!" The frightful news
soon spread through St. Gall. "He has slain his brother,
as Cain slew Abel," said the people.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> The culprit was
seized. "It is true I did it," he continually repeated; "but
it is God who did it through me." On the 16th of February,
this unhappy creature lost his head by the sword of the
executioner. Fanaticism had made its last effort. Men's
eyes were opened, and, according to an old historian, the
same blow took off the head of Thomas Schucker and of
fanaticism in Saint Gall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISCUSSION AT ZURICH.</div>

<p>It still prevailed at Zurich. On the 6th of November in
the preceding year, a public discussion on the subject of
infant baptism<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> had been held in the council hall, when
Zwingle and his friends proposed the following theses:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Children born of believing parents are children of God,
like those who were born under the Old Testament, and
consequently may receive baptism.<a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p>"Baptism<a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> under the New Testament is what circumcision
was under the Old; consequently, baptism ought
now to be administered to children, as circumcision was
formerly.</p>

<p>"We cannot prove the custom of re-baptizing<a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> either by
examples, texts, or arguments drawn from Scripture; and
those who are re-baptized crucify Jesus Christ afresh."</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIMITS OF THE REFORMATION.</div>

<p>But the dispute was not confined to religious questions;
they called for the abolition of tithes, on the ground that
they were not of Divine appointment. Zwingle replied,
that the maintenance of the schools and churches depended
on the tithes. He desired a complete religious reform;
but was decided not to permit the public order or
political institutions to be in the least degree shaken. This
was the limit at which he perceived that word from heaven,
written by the hand of God, "Hitherto shalt thou come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
and no farther."<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> It was necessary to stop somewhere,
and here Zwingle and the reformers halted, in spite of
those headstrong men who endeavoured to hurry them farther
still.</p>

<p>But if the reformers halted, they could not stop the enthusiasts,
who seemed placed at their sides as if in contrast
with their discretion and prudence. It was not enough for
them to have formed a church; this church in their eyes
was the state. When they were summoned before the tribunals,
they declared they did not recognise the civil authority,
that it was only a remnant of paganism, and that they
would obey no other power than God. They taught that
it was not lawful for Christians to fill public offices, or to
carry the sword; and resembling in this respect certain
irreligious enthusiasts that have sprung up in our days, they
looked upon a community of goods as the perfection of
humanity.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>Thus the danger was increasing; the existence of civil
society was threatened. It rose up to reject from its bosom
these destructive elements. The government, in alarm,
suffered itself to be hurried into strange measures. Being
resolved to make an example, it condemned Mantz to be
drowned. On the 5th of January 1527, he was placed in
a boat; his mother (the aged concubine of the canon) and
his brother were among the crowd that followed him to the
water's edge. "Persevere unto the end," exclaimed they.
When the executioner prepared to throw Mantz into the
lake, his brother burst into tears; but his mother, calm and
resolute, witnessed with dry and burning eyes the martyrdom
of her son.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p>On the same day Blaurock was scourged with rods. As
they were leading him outside of the city, he shook his blue
cloak and the dust from off his feet against the state of
Zurich.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> It would appear that two years later this unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
creature was burnt alive by the Roman-catholics of the
Tyrol.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIBERTY AND INTOLERANCE.</div>

<p>Undoubtedly a spirit of rebellion existed; no doubt the
old ecclesiastical law, condemning heretics to death, was
still in force, and the Reformation could not in one or two
years reform every error; and further, there is no question
that the Romish states would have accused the Protestant
states of encouraging disorder if they had not punished
these enthusiasts; but these considerations may explain,
although they cannot justify, the severity of the magistrates.
They might have taken measures against everything
that infringed the civil authority; but religious errors,
being combated by the teachers, should have enjoyed complete
liberty before the civil tribunals. Such opinions are
not to be expelled by the scourge; they are not drowned
by throwing their professors into the water; they float up
again from the depth of the abyss; and fire but serves to
kindle in their adherents a fiercer enthusiasm and thirst for
martyrdom. Zwingle, with whose sentiments on this subject
we are acquainted, took no part in these severities.<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Progression and Immobility&mdash;Zwingle and Luther&mdash;Luther's Return to
Scholasticism&mdash;Respect for Tradition&mdash;Occam&mdash;Contrary Tendency
in Zwingle&mdash;Beginning of the Controversy&mdash;&OElig;colampadius and the
Swabian Syngramma&mdash;Strasburg mediates.</p></blockquote>


<p>It was not, however, on baptism<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> alone that diversities
were to prevail; more serious differences were to arise on
the doctrine of the Lord's Supper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROGRESSION AND IMMOBILITY.</div>

<p>The human mind, freed from the yoke that had pressed
upon it for so many ages, made use of its liberty; and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Roman-catholicism has to fear the shoals of despotism, Protestantism
is equally exposed to those of anarchy. Progression
is the character of Protestantism, as immobility is that
of Romanism.</p>

<p>Roman-catholicism, which possesses in the papacy a
means of continually establishing new doctrines, appears at
first sight, indeed, to contain a principle eminently favourable
to variations. It has in truth largely availed itself of
it, and from age to age we see Rome bringing forward or
ratifying new doctrines. But its system once complete,
Roman-catholicism has declared itself the champion of immobility.
In this its safety lies; it resembles those buildings
which tremble at the least motion, and from which nothing
can be taken without bringing them wholly to the ground.
Permit the Romish priests to marry, or aim a blow at the
doctrine of transubstantiation, and the whole system is shaken,
the whole edifice crumbles into dust.</p>

<p>It is not thus with evangelical Christianity. Its principle
is much less favourable to variations, and much more so to
progression and to life. In fact, on the one hand it recognises
Scripture only as the source of truth, one and always the
same, from the beginning of the Church to the end: how
then should it vary as Popery has done? But, on the other
hand, each Christian is to go and draw for himself from this
fountain; and hence proceed action and liberty. Accordingly,
evangelical Christianity, while it is the same in the
nineteenth as in the sixteenth century, and as in the first,
is in every age full of spontaneity and motion, and is now filling
the world with its researches, its labours, bibles, missionaries,
light, salvation, and life.</p>

<p>It is a great error to classify together and almost to confound
evangelical Christianity with mysticism and rationalism,
and to impute their irregularities to it. Motion is in
the very nature of Christian Protestantism; it is directly
opposed to immobility and lethargy; but it is the motion of
health and life that characterizes it, and not the aberrations
of man deprived of reason, or the convulsions of disease. We
shall see this characteristic manifested in the doctrine of the
Lord's Supper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE AND LUTHER.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>Such a result might have been expected. This doctrine
had been understood in very different manners in the former
ages of the Church, and this diversity existed until the time
when the doctrine of transubstantiation and the scholastic
theology began simultaneously to rule over the middle ages.
But when this dominion was shaken, the old diversities were
destined to reappear.</p>

<p>Zwingle and Luther, who had each been developed separately,
the one in Switzerland and the other in Saxony,
were however one day to meet face to face. The same
spirit, and in many respects the same character, animated
both. Both alike were filled with love for the truth and
hatred of injustice; both were naturally violent; and this
violence was moderated in each by a sincere piety. But
there was one feature in Zwingle's character destined to carry
him farther than Luther. It was not only as a man that he
loved liberty, but also as a republican and fellow-countryman
of Tell. Accustomed to the decision of a free state, he did
not permit himself to be stopped by those considerations
before which Luther recoiled. He had moreover studied
less profoundly the scholastic theology, and thus found his
motions less fettered. Both were ardently attached to their
own convictions; both resolved to defend them; and, little
habituated to yield to the convictions of another, they
were now to meet, like two proud war-horses, which, rushing
through the contending ranks, suddenly encounter each other
in the hottest of the strife.</p>

<p>A practical tendency predominated in the character of
Zwingle and in the Reformation of which he was the author,
and this tendency was directed to two great objects, simplicity
of worship and sanctification of life. To harmonize
the worship with the necessities of the mind, that seeks not
external pomp but invisible things&mdash;this was Zwingle's first
aim. The idea of the corporeal presence of Christ in the
Lord's Supper, the origin of so many ceremonies and superstitions
of the Church, must therefore be abolished. But
another desire of the Swiss reformer led to the same results.
He found that the Roman doctrine of the eucharist, and even
that of Luther, presupposed a certain magical influence prejudicial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
to sanctification; he feared lest Christians, imagining
they received Jesus Christ in the consecrated bread,
should henceforward less earnestly seek to be united to him
by faith in the heart. "Faith," said he, "is not knowledge,
opinion, imagination; it is a reality.<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> It leads to a real
union with Divine things." Thus, whatever Zwingle's adversaries
may have asserted, it was not a leaning to rationalism,
but a profoundly religious view, that led him to his
peculiar doctrines.</p>

<p>But there was another element in Zwingle's convictions:
he was subject to those historical influences which we must
everywhere recognise in the annals of the Church as in that
of the world. It has been long supposed that he was acquainted
with the sentiments of Ratram, Wickliffe, and Peter
Waldo; but we possess a much safer historical clue to the
convictions of the Swiss reformer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NETHERLANDERS AT ZURICH.</div>

<p>The two Netherlanders, Rhodius and Sagarus, whom we
have seen arrive at Wittemberg, and there occasion the
first difference between Luther and Carlstadt, had turned
their steps towards Switzerland, carrying with them Wessel's
manuscripts, and reached Basle, where Luther himself
had commended them to &OElig;colampadius. The latter person,
who was of timid character, finding that Luther did not approve
of the opinions which these brethren from Holland
were endeavouring to propagate, did not venture to declare
his sentiments, and sent them to Zwingle. They arrived at
Zurich in 1521, and having waited on the reformer, immediately
turned the conversation on the doctrine of the Lord's
Supper.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">RESULT OF ZWINGLE'S INQUIRIES.</div>

<p>Rhodius and his friend did not at first make known their
opinions, but after listening to Zwingle, they gave thanks to
God for having delivered them from so great an error.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>
They then presented the letter from Cornelius Hoen, which
Zwingle read, and published shortly after.</p>

<p>This letter had an incalculable influence on the destinies
of the Reformation. Hoen, resting his arguments on Christ's
words in the sixth chapter of Saint John, said: "Christ
gives himself to us by means of the bread:<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> but let us distinguish
between the bread we receive by the mouth, and
Christ whom we receive by faith. Whoever thinks that he
receives only what he takes into his mouth, does not discern
the body of the Lord, and eats and drinks his own condemnation,
because by eating and drinking he bears testimony
to the presence of Christ, whilst by his unbelief he remains
far from Him."&mdash;At the same time the Netherlanders laid
Wessel's theses before Zwingle.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> These writings made a
deep impression on the reformer's mind.</p>

<p>The result of Zwingle's inquiries corresponded with his
tendencies. By studying Scripture as a whole, which was
his custom, and not in detached passages, and by having recourse
to classical antiquity for the solution of the difficulties
of language, he arrived at the conviction that the word is,
employed in the formula of the institution of the Lord's
Supper, ought to be taken (as Hoen said) in the meaning
of <i>signifies</i>, and as early as 1523 he wrote to his friend
Wittembach that the bread and wine are in the Eucharist
what the water is in baptism. "It would be in vain,"
added he, "for us to plunge a man a thousand times in
water, if he does not believe. Faith is the one thing needful."<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<p>It would appear, besides, that Zwingle had been prepared,<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>
indirectly at least, for these views by Erasmus.
Melancthon says: "Zwingle confessed to me (at Marburg)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
that it was originally from the writings of Erasmus that he
had derived his opinions on the Lord's Supper." In fact
Erasmus wrote in 1526: "The sentiments of &OElig;colampadius
would not displease me if the testimony of the
Church were not against them. I do not see what an insensible
body can do, or what utility would be derived from
it, even if we could feel it; it is enough that spiritual grace
be found in the symbols."<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S RETURN TO SCHOLASTICISM.</div>

<p>Luther at first set out, in appearance at least, from principles
very similar to those of the Zurich doctor. "It is not the
sacrament that sanctifieth," said he, "but faith in the sacrament."
But the extravagances of those whose mysticism
spiritualized everything, led to a great change in his
views. When he saw enthusiasts who pretended to a particular
inspiration, breaking images, rejecting baptism,<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> and
denying the presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, he was
alarmed; he had a sort of prophetic presentiment of the dangers
that would threaten the Church if this ultra-spiritual
tendency should get the upperhand, and he accordingly threw
himself into the very opposite course; like a pilot who,
seeing his boat lean too much on one side and near foundering,
throws himself on the other to restore the equilibrium.</p>

<p>From that time Luther attached a higher importance to the
sacraments. He maintained that they were not only signs,
by means of which Christians were outwardly distinguished,
as Zwingle said, but testimonials of the Divine will, calculated
to strengthen our faith. More than this, Christ, in his
view, had determined to give believers a full assurance of
their salvation, and in order to seal this promise in the most
effectual manner, he had added his real body to the bread
and wine. "Just as iron and fire," continued he, "which
are nevertheless two distinct substances, are confounded together
in a heated mass of iron so that in each of its parts
there is at once iron and fire; in like manner, and with
much greater reason, the glorified body of Christ is found
in all the parts of the bread."</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESPECT FOR TRADITION.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>Thus at this period there seems to have been some
return on the part of Luther towards the scholastic theology.
In his doctrine of justification by faith he had entirely
renounced it; but in that of the sacrament he abandoned
one point only, transubstantiation, and preserved the other,
the corporeal presence. He even went so far as to say, that
he would rather receive the blood only with the pope, than
the wine only with Zwingle.</p>

<p>Luther's great principle was never to depart from the
doctrine and customs of the Church, except when the language
of Scripture rendered it absolutely necessary. "Where
has Christ commanded us to elevate the host and exhibit
it to the people?" Carlstadt had demanded.&mdash;"And where
has Christ forbidden it?" was Luther's reply. In this
answer lies the principle of the two Reformations. Ecclesiastical
traditions were dear to the Saxon reformer. If he
separated from them on several points, it was not until after
terrible struggles, and because, above all, it was necessary
to obey the Scriptures. But when the letter of the Word
of God appeared in harmony with the tradition and usages
of the Church, he adhered to it with immovable firmness.
Now this was what happened in the question of the eucharist.
He did not deny that the word <i>is</i> might be taken in the
sense indicated by Zwingle. He acknowledged, for instance,
that in the words, <i>That rock was Christ</i>,<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> it must be so understood;
but he denied that this word must have the same
meaning in the institution of the Lord's Supper.</p>

<p>He found in one of the later schoolmen, Occam,<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> whom
he preferred to all others, an opinion which he embraced.
Like Occam, he gave up the continually repeated miracle,
by virtue of which, according to the Roman Church, the
body and blood of Christ took the place of the bread and
wine after every consecration by the priest; and with this
doctor, he substituted a universal miracle, worked once for
all,&mdash;that of the ubiquity and omnipresence of the body of
Jesus Christ. "Christ," said he, "is present in the bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and wine, because he is present everywhere, and above all,
wherever he wills to be."<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S TURN OF MIND.</div>

<p>The turn of Zwingle's mind was very different from
Luther's. He was less inclined to preserve a certain union
with the universal Church and to maintain his connexion
with the traditions of past ages. As a theologian, he looked
at Scripture alone, and thence only would he receive his
faith freely and immediately, without troubling himself
about what others had thought before him. As a republican,
he looked to his <i>commune</i> of Zurich. It was the idea
of the present Church that engrossed his thoughts, and not
that of the Church of former times. He clung particularly
to these words of St. Paul: <i>For we being many are one
bread, and one body</i>; and he saw in the Lord's Supper the
sign of a spiritual communion between Christ and all
Christians. "Whoever acts unworthily," said he, "is guilty
towards the body of Christ of which he is a member." This
thought had a great practical influence over men's minds;
and the effects it produced in the lives of many confirmed
Zwingle in it.</p>

<p>Thus Luther and Zwingle had insensibly separated from
each other. It is probable however that peace might have
subsisted longer between them, if the turbulent Carlstadt, who
kept passing to and fro between Switzerland and Germany,
had not inflamed these contrary opinions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BEGINNING OF THE CONTROVERSY.</div>

<p>A step taken with a view to maintain peace led to the
explosion. The council of Zurich, desirous of preventing all
controversy, forbade the sale of Carlstadt's works. Zwingle,
who disapproved of his violence, and blamed his mystical
and obscure expressions,<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> thought himself now called upon
to defend his doctrine, both in the pulpit and before the
council; and shortly after wrote a letter to Albert, pastor of
Reutlingen, in which he said: "Whether or not Christ speaks
of the sacrament in the sixth chapter of St. John, it is very
evident that he there inculcates a manner of eating his
flesh and drinking his blood, in which there is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
corporeal."<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> He then proceeded to prove that the Lord's
Supper, by reminding the faithful, according to Christ's
intention, of his body which was broken for them, procured
for them that spiritual eating which alone is truly
salutary.</p>

<p>Yet Zwingle shrunk from a rupture with Luther; he
trembled at the thought that these unhappy disputes might
tear in pieces that new society which was then forming in the
midst of fallen Christendom. But it was not so with Luther.
He did not hesitate to class Zwingle with those enthusiasts
against whom he had already broken so many lances.
He did not reflect that if the images had been taken down
at Zurich, it was done legally and by order of the public
authority. Accustomed to the forms of the German principalities,
he knew but little of the proceedings of the Swiss
republics; and he inveighed against the grave divines
of Helvetia, as he had done against the Munzers and
Carlstadts.</p>

<p>Luther having published his <i>Treatise against the Celestial
Prophets</i>, Zwingle no longer hesitated, and at nearly the
same time he gave to the world his <i>Letter to Albert</i>, and his
<i>Commentary on True and False Religion</i>, dedicated to
Francis I. In this last he said: "Since Christ, in the sixth
chapter of St. John, ascribes to faith the power of imparting
eternal life, and of uniting the believer to Him in the closest
union, what need have we of more? Why should He afterwards
have ascribed this virtue to His flesh, whilst He himself
declares that His flesh profiteth nothing? The flesh of Christ,
so far as it suffered death for us, is of incalculable utility,
for it saves us from perdition; so far as it is eaten by us, it
is of no use whatever."</p>

<p>The struggle began. Pomeranus, Luther's friend, rushed
into the conflict, and attacked the evangelist of Zurich
somewhat too contemptuously. &OElig;colampadius then began
to blush at having so long combated his doubts, and at
having preached doctrines that already began to waver in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
his mind. He took courage, and wrote from Basle to Zwingle:
"The dogma of the real presence is the fortress and
safeguard of their impiety. So long as they preserve this
idol, no one can conquer them." He then entered into the
lists, by publishing a book on the meaning of our Lord's
words: <i>This is my body</i>.<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SWABIAN SYNGRAMMA.</div>

<p>The mere fact that &OElig;colampadius had joined the reformer
of Zurich excited an immense sensation, not only in Basle
but in all Germany. Luther was deeply affected by it.
Brenz, Schnepff, and twelve other pastors of Swabia, to
whom &OElig;colampadius had dedicated his book, and most of
whom had been his pupils, experienced the keenest sorrow.
"At this very moment when I am separating from him in
a just cause," said Brenz, taking up the pen to reply to him,
"I honour and admire him as much as it is possible for a
man to do. The bonds of love are not broken between us because
we are not of one opinion." He then published, conjointly
with his friends, the famous <i>Swabian Syngramma</i>,
in which he replied to &OElig;colampadius with firmness but with
charity and respect. "If an emperor," said the authors,
"give a wand to a judge, saying: 'Take; this is the power
of judging;' the wand no doubt is a mere sign; but the
words being added, the judge has not only the symbol but
the power itself." The true members of the reformed
churches may admit this illustration. The <i>Syngramma</i>
was received with acclamations; its authors were looked
upon as the champions of truth; many theologians, and
even laymen, desirous of sharing in their glory, began
to defend the doctrine attacked, and fell upon &OElig;colampadius.</p>

<p>Strasburg then came forward to mediate between Switzerland
and Germany. Capito and Bucer were the friends
of peace, and the question in debate was, in their opinion,
of secondary consequence; they therefore placed themselves
between the two parties, sent one of their colleagues, George
Cassel, to Luther, and conjured him to beware of snapping the
ties of fraternity which united him with the Swiss divines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S CHARACTER&mdash;CONSEQUENCES.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>Nowhere did Luther's character shine forth more strikingly
than in this controversy on the Lord's Supper. Never
were more clearly displayed that firmness with which he
clung to a conviction which he believed to be christian, his
faithfulness in seeking for no other foundation than Scripture,
the sagacity of his defence, his animated eloquence,
and often overwhelming powers of argumentation. But
never also were more clearly shown the obstinacy with
which he adhered to his own opinions, the little attention he
paid to the reasons of his opponents, and the uncharitable
haste with which he ascribed their errors to the wickedness
of their hearts, or to the wiles of the devil. "One or other
of us," said he to the Strasburg mediator, "must be ministers
of Satan&mdash;the Swiss or ourselves."</p>

<p>This was what Capito styled "the frenzies of the Saxon
Orestes;" and these frenzies were followed by exhaustion.
Luther's health was affected by them; one day he fainted in
the arms of his wife and friends; he was a whole week as
if in "death and hell."<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>&mdash;"He had lost Jesus Christ," he
said, "and was tossed to and fro by the tempests of despair.
The world was passing away, and announcing by prodigies
that the last day was at hand."</p>

<p>But the divisions among the friends of the Reformation
were destined to have still more fatal consequences. The
Romish theologians exulted, particularly in Switzerland, at
being able to oppose Luther to Zwingle. And yet if, after
three centuries, the recollection of these divisions should
convey to evangelical Christians the precious fruits of unity
in diversity, and of charity in liberty, they will not have
been in vain. Even then, the reformers, by opposing one
another, showed that they were not governed by a blind
hatred against Rome, and that truth was the primary object
of their inquiries. Herein we must acknowledge there is
something generous; and conduct so disinterested did not
fail to bear fruit, and to extort, even from enemies, a feeling
of interest and esteem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIFFERENT TENDENCIES.</div>

<p>And further than this, we may here again recognise that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
sovereign hand which directs all things, and permits nothing
without the wisest design. Luther, notwithstanding his
opposition to the Papacy, was in an eminent degree conservative.
Zwingle, on the contrary, was inclined to a radical
reform. These two opposite tendencies were necessary.
If Luther and his friends had stood alone at the time of the
Reformation, the work would have been stopped too soon,
and the reforming principle would not have accomplished its
prescribed task. If, on the contrary, there had been only
Zwingle, the thread would have been snapped too abruptly,
and the Reformation would have been isolated from the
ages that had gone before.</p>

<p>These two tendencies, which to a superficial observer
might seem to have existed only to combat each other, were
ordained to complete each other; and after a lapse of three
centuries we can say that they have fulfilled their mission.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">The Tockenburg&mdash;An Assembly of the People&mdash;Reformation&mdash;The
Grisons&mdash;Disputation at Ilantz&mdash;Results&mdash;Reformation at Zurich.</p></blockquote>


<p>Thus the Reformation had struggles to maintain in every
quarter, and after having contended with the rationalist
philosophy of Erasmus, and the fanaticism of some of the
anabaptists,<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> it had still to endure an intestine war. But its
great conflict was always with popery; and the attack begun
in the cities of the plain was now carried on among the
most distant mountains.</p>

<p>The mountains of the Tockenburg had heard the sound
of the Gospel, and three ecclesiastics were there persecuted
by order of the bishop, as inclining to heresy. "Convince
us by the Word of God," said Militus, Döring, and Farer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
"and we will submit not only to the chapter, but even to the
least of our brethren in Christ; otherwise we will obey no
one, not even the mightiest among men."<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A MEETING IN THE TOCKENBURG.</div>

<p>This was truly the spirit of Zwingle and of the Reformation.
A circumstance occurred shortly after that inflamed
the minds of the inhabitants of these lofty valleys. A meeting
of the people took place on Saint Catherine's day; the
citizens were assembled, and two men of Schwytz, having
come to the Tockenburg on business, were seated at one
of the tables; they entered into conversation. "Ulrich
Zwingle," said one of them, "is a heretic and a robber!"
Steiger, the secretary of state, undertook Zwingle's defence.
Their noise attracted the attention of the whole meeting.
George Bruggmann, Zwingle's uncle, who was at an adjoining
table, sprung angrily from his seat, exclaiming: "Surely
they are speaking of Master Ulrich!" All the guests rose
and followed him, fearing a brawl.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> As the tumult kept
increasing, the bailiff hastily assembled the council in the
street, and prayed Bruggmann, for the sake of peace, to be
content with saying to these men: "If you do not retract
your words, it is you who are guilty of lying and thieving."&mdash;"Recollect
what you have just said," replied the men
of Schwytz; "be sure we shall remember them." They
then mounted their horses, and galloped off on the road to
Schwytz.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></p>

<p>The government of Schwytz then addressed a threatening
letter to the inhabitants of the Tockenburg, which spread
dismay among them. "Be bold and fearless,"<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> wrote Zwingle
to the council of his native place. "Be not concerned at the
lies they utter against me! Any brawler can call me a
heretic; but do you refrain from insults, disorders, debauchery,
and mercenary wars; relieve the poor, protect those
who are oppressed, and whatever abuse may be heaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
upon you, preserve an unshaken confidence in Almighty
God."<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<p>Zwingle's exhortations produced the desired effect. The
council still hesitated, but the people, meeting in their respective
parishes, unanimously decreed that the mass should
be abolished, and that they would be faithful to the Word
of God.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GRISONS&mdash;DISCUSSIONS AT ILANTZ.</div>

<p>The conquests were not less important in Rhætia, which
Salandronius had been compelled to leave, but where Comander
was boldly proclaiming the Gospel. The enthusiasts,
indeed, by preaching their fanatical doctrines in the Grisons,
had at first done great mischief to the Reformation. The
people were divided into three parties. Some had embraced
the views of these new prophets; others, amazed and confounded,
regarded this schism with anxiety; and lastly, the
partisans of Rome were loud in their exultation.<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>

<p>A meeting was held at Ilantz, in the gray league, for a
public disputation; the supporters of the papacy, on the one
hand, the friends of the Reformation on the other, collected
their forces. The bishop's vicar at first sought how to evade
the combat. "These disputes lead to great expense," said
he; "I am ready to lay down ten thousand florins in order
to meet them; but I require the opposite party to do as
much."&mdash;"If the bishop has ten thousand florins at his disposal,"
exclaimed the rough voice of a peasant in the crowd,
"it is from us he has wrung them; to give as much more
to these poor priests would be too bad."&mdash;"We are poor
people with empty purses," said Comander, pastor of Coire;
"we have hardly the means of buying food: where then can
we find ten thousand florins?"<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> Every one laughed at this
expedient, and the business proceeded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BIBLES&mdash;THE THESIS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>Among the spectators were Sebastian Hofmeister and
James Amman of Zurich; they held in their hands the Holy
Bible in Greek and Hebrew. The bishop's vicar desired
that all strangers should be excluded. Hofmeister understood
this to be directed against him. "We have come provided
with a Greek and Hebrew Bible," said he, "in order
that no violence may be done in any manner to Scripture.
Yet sooner than prevent the conference, we are willing to
withdraw."&mdash;"Ah!" exclaimed the priest of Dintzen, looking
at the books of the Zurichers, "if the Greek and Hebrew
languages had never entered our country, there would have
been fewer heresies!"<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>&mdash;"St. Jerome," said another, "has
translated the Bible for us; we do not want the books of the
Jews!"&mdash;"If the Zurichers are turned out," said the banneret
of Ilantz, "the <i>commune</i> will interfere."&mdash;"Well then,"
replied others, "let them listen, but be silent." The Zurichers
remained accordingly, and their Bible with them.</p>

<p>After this Comander stood up and read the first of the
theses he had published; it ran thus: "The christian Church
is born of the Word of God; it must abide by this Word,
and listen to no other voice." He then proved what he had
advanced by numerous passages from Scripture. "He trod
with a firm step," said an eye-witness,<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> "each time setting
down his foot with the firmness of an ox."&mdash;"There is too
much of this," said the vicar.&mdash;"When he is at table with
his friends listening to the pipers," said Hofmeister, "he
does not find it too long."<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SCHOOLMASTER&mdash;SACRAMENTS&mdash;RESULTS.</div>

<p>Then a man arose and advanced from the midst of the
crowd, tossing his arms, knitting his brows, blinking his
eyes,<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> and who appeared to have lost his senses; he rushed
towards the reformer, and many thought he was about to
strike him. He was a schoolmaster of Coire. "I have
committed several questions to writing," said he to Comander;
"answer them instantly."&mdash;"I am here," said the reformer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the Grisons, "to defend my doctrine: attack it, and I will
defend it; or else return to your place. I will answer you
when I have done." The schoolmaster remained a moment
in suspense. "Very well," said he at last, and returned to
his seat.</p>

<p>It was proposed to pass on to the doctrine of the sacraments.
The Abbot of St. Luke's declared that he could not
approach such a subject without awe, and the horrified curate
in alarm made the sign of the cross.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster of Coire, who had already made one attempt
to attack Comander, began with much volubility to
argue in favour of the doctrine of the sacrament according to
the text, "This <i>is</i> my body."&mdash;"My dear Berre," said Comander,
"how do you understand these words, John is
Elias?"&mdash;"I understand," replied Berre, who saw what Comander
was aiming at, "that he was really and essentially
Elias."&mdash;"Why then," continued Comander, "did John the
Baptist himself say to the Pharisees that he was not Elias?"
The schoolmaster was silent: at last he replied, "It is true."
Everybody began to laugh, even those who had urged him
to speak.</p>

<p>The Abbot of St. Luke's made a long speech on the eucharist,
which closed the conference. Seven priests embraced
the evangelical doctrine; complete religious liberty was proclaimed,
and the Romish worship was abolished in several
churches. "Christ," to use the language of Salandronius,
"grew up everywhere in these mountains, as the tender
grass of spring; and the pastors were like living fountains,
watering these lofty valleys."<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></p>

<p>The Reform made still more rapid strides at Zurich. The
Dominicans, the Augustines, the Capuchins, so long at
enmity, were reduced to the necessity of living together;
a foretaste of hell for these poor monks. In the place of
these corrupted institutions were founded schools, an hospital,
a theological college: learning and charity everywhere supplanted
indolence and selfishness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">The Oligarchs&mdash;Bernese Mandate of 1526 in Favour of the Papacy&mdash;Discussion
at Baden&mdash;Regulations of the Discussion&mdash;Riches and
Poverty&mdash;Eck and &OElig;colampadius&mdash;Discussion&mdash;Zwingle's Share in the
Discussion&mdash;Vaunts of the Romanists&mdash;Abusive Language of a Monk&mdash;Close
of the Disputation.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">THE OLIGARCHS&mdash;DEPUTATION TO BERNE.</div>

<p>These victories of the Reformation could not remain unnoticed.
Monks, priests, and prelates, in distraction, felt that the
ground was everywhere slipping from beneath their feet, and
that the Romish Church was on the point of sinking under
unprecedented dangers. The oligarchs of the cantons, the
advocates of foreign pensions and capitulations, saw that
they could delay no longer, if they wished to preserve their
privileges; and at the very moment when the Church was
frightened and beginning to sink, they stretched out their
mailed hands to save it. A Stein and a John Hug of Lucerne
united with a John Faber; and the civil authority rushed
to the support of that hierarchical power which openeth its
mouth to blaspheme and maketh war upon the saints.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>Their first efforts were directed against Berne. The seven
Roman-catholic cantons, in collusion with the Bernese
oligarchs, sent a deputation to that city, who laid their
complaints before the council on Whitmonday 1526. "All
order is destroyed in the Church," said the schulthess (chief
magistrate) of Lucerne, "God is blasphemed, the sacraments,
the mother of God, and the saints are despised, and
imminent and terrible calamities threaten to dissolve our
praiseworthy confederation." At the same time the Bernese
partisans of Rome, in harmony with the Forest cantons,
had summoned to Berne the deputies of the country, chosen
from those who were devoted to the papacy. Some of them
had the courage to pronounce in favour of the Gospel. The
sitting was stormy. "Berne must renounce the evangelical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
faith and walk with us," said the Forest cantons. The
Bernese councils decreed that they would maintain "the
ancient christian faith, the holy sacraments, the mother of
God, the saints, and the ornaments of the churches."<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>
Thus Rome triumphed, and the mandate of 1526 was about
to annul that of 1523. In effect, all the married priests
not born in the canton were compelled to leave it; they
drove from their borders all who were suspected of Lutheranism;
they exercised a vigilant censorship over every work
sold by the booksellers, and certain books were publicly
burnt. Even John Faber, with audacious falsehood, said
publicly that Haller had bound himself before the council
to perform mass again, and to preach the doctrine of Rome.
It was resolved to take advantage of so favourable an opportunity
to crush the new faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISPUTATION PROPOSED.</div>

<p>For a long while public opinion had been demanding a
discussion; this was the only means left of quieting the
people.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> "Convince us by the Holy Scriptures," said the
council of Zurich to the diet, "and we will comply with
your wishes."&mdash;"The Zurichers," it was everywhere said,
"have made you a promise; if you can convince them by the
Bible, why not do so? if you cannot, why do you not conform
to the Bible?"</p>

<p>The conferences held at Zurich had exercised an immense
influence, and it was felt necessary to oppose them by a conference
held in a Romish city, with all necessary precautions
to secure the victory to the pope's party.</p>

<p>True, these discussions had been pronounced unlawful,
but means were found to evade this difficulty. "It is
only intended," said they, "to check and condemn the pestilent
doctrines of Zwingle."<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> This being settled, they
looked about for a vigorous champion, and Doctor Eck
offered himself. He feared nothing. "Zwingle no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
has milked more cows than he has read books," said he, by
Hofmeister's account.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">FEARS FOR ZWINGLE.</div>

<p>The Great Council of Zurich sent Dr. Eck a safe-conduct
to go direct to Zurich; but Eck replied that he would wait
for the answer of the confederation. Zwingle then offered
to dispute at Saint Gall or Schaffhausen; but the council,
acting on an article of the federal compact, which provided
"that every accused person should be tried in the place of
his abode," ordered Zwingle to withdraw his offer.</p>

<p>At last the diet fixed that the conference should take
place at Baden on the 16th of May 1526. This meeting
promised to be important; for it was the result and the seal
of the alliance which had just been concluded between the
clergy and the oligarchs of the confederation. "See," said
Zwingle to Vadian, "what Faber and the oligarchs now
venture to attempt."<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, the decision of the diet produced a great sensation
in Switzerland. It was not doubted that a conference
held under such auspices would be favourable to the Reformation.
Are not the five cantons the most devoted to the pope
supreme in Baden, said the Zurichers? Have they not
already declared Zwingle's doctrine heretical, and pursued it
with fire and sword? Was not Zwingle burnt in effigy at
Lucerne, with every mark of ignominy? At Friburg, were
not his writings committed to the flames? Do they not
everywhere call for his death? Have not the cantons that
exercise sovereign rights in Baden declared, that in whatever
part of their territory Zwingle made his appearance, he should
be apprehended?<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> Did not Uberlinger, one of their chiefs,
say that the only thing in the world that he desired was to
hang Zwingle, though he should be called a hangman all
the rest of his days?<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> And has not Doctor Eck himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
for years past, been crying out that the heretics must be attacked
with fire and sword? What then will be the end of
this conference? what other result can it have, but the death
of the reformer?</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MARTYRS OF LINDAU AND FRIBURG.</div>

<p>Such were the fears that agitated the commission appointed
at Zurich to examine into the affair. Zwingle, an eye-witness
of their agitation, rose and said: "You know what
happened at Baden to the valiant men of Stammheim, and
how the blood of the Wirths dyed the scaffold......and it is
to the very place of their execution that they challenge us!......Let
Zurich, Berne, Saint Gall, or even Basle, Constance,
and Schaffhausen, be selected for the conference; let it be
agreed to discuss essential points only, employing nothing
else than the Word of God; let no judge be set above it;
and then I am ready to appear."<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, fanaticism was already bestirring itself and
striking down its victims. A consistory, headed by that
same Faber who had challenged Zwingle, on the 10th of
May 1526, about a week before the discussion at Baden,
condemned to the flames, as a heretic, an evangelical minister
named John Hügel, pastor of Lindau,<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> who walked to the
place of execution singing the <i>Te Deum</i>. At the same time,
another minister, Peter Spengler, was drowned at Friburg by
order of the Bishop of Constance.</p>

<p>Sinister rumours reached Zwingle from all quarters. His
brother-in-law, Leonard Tremp, wrote to him from Berne: "I
entreat you, as you regard your life, not to repair to Baden.
I know that they will not respect your safe-conduct."<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<p>It was affirmed that a plan had been formed to seize and
gag him, throw him into a boat, and carry him off to some
secret place.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> With these threats and persecutions before
them, the council of Zurich decreed that Zwingle should not
go to Baden.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">&OElig;COLAMPADIUS&mdash;REGULATIONS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>The discussion being fixed for the 19th of May, the disputants
and the representatives of the cantons and bishops
began to arrive gradually. On the side of the Roman-catholics
appeared in the foremost place the warlike and vain-glorious
Doctor Eck; on the side of the Protestants, the retiring
and gentle &OElig;colampadius. The latter was well aware of the
perils attending this discussion. "He had long hesitated,
like a timid stag worried by furious dogs," says an old historian;
at length he decided on going to Baden, previously
making this solemn declaration, "I acknowledge no other
standard of judgment than the Word of God." At first, he
had earnestly desired that Zwingle should share his danger;<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>
but he soon became convinced that, if the intrepid doctor
had appeared in that fanatical city, the anger of the Romanists,
kindling at his sight, would have caused the death of
both of them.</p>

<p>They began by determining the regulations of the conference.
Doctor Eck proposed that the deputies of the Forest
Cantons should be empowered to pronounce the final judgment;
which was, in truth, anticipating the condemnation
of the reformed doctrines. Thomas Plater, who had come
from Zurich to attend the colloquy, was despatched by
&OElig;colampadius to ask Zwingle's advice. Arriving during
the night, he was with difficulty admitted into the reformer's
house. "Unlucky disturber," said Zwingle to him, as he
rubbed his eyes, "for six weeks I have not gone to bed,
owing to this discussion.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>......What are your tidings?"
Plater stated Eck's demands. "And who can make those
peasants understand such things?" replied Zwingle; "they
would be much more at home in milking their cows."<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ECK AND &OElig;COLAMPADIUS.</div>

<p>On the 21st of May the conference opened. Eck and
Faber, accompanied by prelates, magistrates, and doctors,
robed in garments of damask and silk, and adorned with rings,
chains, and crosses,<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> repaired to the church. Eck haughtily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
ascended a pulpit splendidly decorated, while the humble
&OElig;colampadius, meanly clothed, was forced to take his seat in
front of his opponent on a rudely carved stool. "All the time
the conference lasted," said the chronicler Bullinger, "Eck
and his friends were lodged at the Baden parsonage, faring
sumptuously, living gaily and scandalously, and drinking
much wine, with which the abbot of Wettingen provided
them.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> Eck took the baths at Baden (it was said) but......in
wine. The evangelicals, on the contrary, made a sorry
appearance, and the people laughed at them as at a troop of
mendicants. Their way of living was in strong contrast to
that of the papal champions. The landlord of the Pike,
the inn at which &OElig;colampadius lodged, being curious to
know what the latter did in his room, reported that every
time he peeped in, he found him reading or praying. It
must be confessed (said he) that he is a very pious heretic."</p>

<p>The disputation lasted eighteen days, and during the
whole time the clergy walked daily in solemn procession,
chanting litanies in order to ensure victory. Eck alone
spoke in defence of the Romish doctrines. He was still the
champion of the Leipsic disputation, with the same German
accent, broad shoulders, and strong lungs, an excellent town-crier,
and in outward appearance having more resemblance
to a butcher than a theologian. According to his usual
custom he disputed with great violence, seeking to gall his
adversaries by sarcasm, and from time to time slipping out
an oath.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> But the president never called him to order.</p>

</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">THE DISCUSSION&mdash;ZWINGLE'S SHARE.</div>

<p>&OElig;colampadius, on the contrary, with his calm features
and noble and patriarchal air, spoke with so much mildness,
and at the same time with such courage and ability, that
even his adversaries, affected and impressed, said one to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
another: "Oh! that the tall sallow man were on our
side."<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>......At times, however, he was moved when he saw
the hatred and violence of his auditors: "How impatiently
they listen to me!" said he; "but God will not forsake
His glory, and that is all we seek."<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a></p>

<p>&OElig;colampadius having combated Dr. Eck's first thesis on
the real presence, Haller, who had come to Baden after the
opening of the conference, entered the lists against the
second. But little used to such conferences, of a timid
character, tied down by the orders of his government, and
embarrassed by the looks of his avoyer Gaspard of Mullinen,
a great enemy to the Reformation, Haller possessed not
the haughty confidence of his opponent; but he had more
real strength. When Haller had finished, &OElig;colampadius
returned to the combat, and pressed Eck so closely, that
the latter was compelled to fall back on the customs of the
Church. "Custom," replied &OElig;colampadius, "has no force
in our Switzerland, unless it be according to the constitution;
now, in matters of faith, the Bible is our constitution."</p>

<p>The third thesis on the invocation of saints; the fourth on
images; the fifth on purgatory, were successively discussed.
No one rose to contest the truth of the two last, which turned
on original sin and baptism.</p>

<p>Zwingle took an active part in the whole of the discussion.
The Romish party, which had appointed four secretaries,
had forbidden all other persons to take notes under pain of
death.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> But Jerome Walsch, a student from the Valais, who
possessed an excellent memory, impressed on his mind all
that he heard, and on returning home, hastened to commit it
to writing. Thomas Plater and Zimmerman of Winterthur
carried these notes to Zwingle every day, with letters from
&OElig;colampadius, and brought back the reformer's answers.
Soldiers armed with halberds were posted at all the gates
of Baden, and it was only by inventing different excuses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
that these two messengers evaded the inquiries of the
sentinels, who could not understand why they were so
frequently passing to and fro.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> Thus Zwingle, though
absent from Baden in body, was present in spirit.</p>

<p>He advised and strengthened his friends, and refuted his
adversaries. "Zwingle," said Oswald Myconius, "has
laboured more by his meditations, his sleepless nights, and
the advice which he transmitted to Baden, than he would
have done by discussing in person in the midst of his
enemies."<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ROMISH BOASTS&mdash;ABUSE OF A MONK.</div>

<p>During the whole conference, the Roman-catholics were
in commotion, sending letters in every direction and loudly
boasting of their victory. "&OElig;colampadius," exclaimed they,
"vanquished by Dr. Eck and laid prostrate in the lists, has
sung his recantation;<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> the dominion of the pope will be everywhere
restored."<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> These statements were circulated through
the cantons, and the people, prompt to believe everything
they hear, gave credit to all the vaunts of the Romish
partisans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">END OF THE DISCUSSION.</div>

<p>When the dispute was finished, the monk Murner of Lucerne,
nicknamed "the tom-cat," stepped forward, and read
forty charges against Zwingle. "I thought," said he, "that
the coward would come and reply to them; but he has not
appeared. Well, then, by every law, both human and divine,
I declare forty times that the tyrant of Zurich and all his
partisans are traitors, liars, perjurers, adulterers, infidels,
robbers, sacrilegers, gallows-birds, and such that every
honest man must blush at having any intercourse whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
with them." Such was the abuse which at this time was
honoured with the name of "christian controversy," by
doctors whom the Romish church should herself disavow.</p>

<p>Great agitation prevailed in Baden; the general impression
was, that the Roman champions had talked the loudest,
but argued the weakest.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> Only &OElig;colampadius and ten of
his friends voted against Eck's theses; while eighty persons,
including the presidents of the debate and all the
monks of Wittingen, adopted them. Haller had quitted
Baden before the end of the conference.</p>

<p>The majority of the diet then decreed that, as Zwingle, the
chief of this pestilent doctrine, had refused to appear, and as
the ministers who had come to Baden had resisted all conviction,
they were all together cast out from the bosom of
the catholic church.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Consequences at Basle, Berne, Saint Gall, and other Places&mdash;Diet at
Zurich&mdash;The small Cantons&mdash;Threats against Berne&mdash;Foreign Support.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">CONSEQUENCES AT BASLE AND BERNE.</div>

<p>But this famous conference, owing to the zeal of the oligarchs
and clergy, was destined to be fatal to both. Those
who had combated for the Gospel were, on their return
home, to fill their countrymen with enthusiasm for the cause
they had defended, and two of the most important cantons
in the Helvetic alliance, Berne and Basle, were thenceforth
to begin their separation from the papacy.</p>

<p>The first blows were to fall on &OElig;colampadius, a stranger
in Switzerland; and he did not return to Basle without
apprehension. But his anxiety was soon dissipated. The
mildness of his language had struck all impartial witnesses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
much more than the clamours of Dr. Eck, and all
pious men received him with acclamation. The adversaries
made, in truth, every exertion to drive him from the pulpit,
but in vain; he taught and preached with greater energy
than before, and the people had never shown such thirst for
the Word.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p>

<p>Similar results followed at Berne. The conference at
Baden, intended to crush the Reformation, gave it a new
impulse in this canton, the most powerful of all the Swiss
league. Haller had no sooner arrived in the capital, than
the Smaller Council had summoned him before them, and
ordered him to celebrate the mass. Haller demanded permission
to reply before the Great Council, and the people,
thinking it their duty to defend their pastor, hastened to the
spot. Haller in alarm declared that he would rather leave
the city than be the occasion of any disturbance. Upon
this, tranquillity being restored: "If I am required to perform
this ceremony," said the reformer, "I must resign my
office; the honour of God and the truth of his Holy Word
are dearer to me than any care about what I shall eat or
wherewithal I shall be clothed." Haller uttered these words
with emotion; the members of the council were affected;
even some of his opponents burst into tears.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> Once more
it was found that moderation was stronger than power.
To satisfy Rome in some degree, Haller was deprived of his
canonry, but nominated preacher. His most violent enemies,
Lewis and Anthony Diesbach, and Anthony d'Erlach, incensed
at this resolution, immediately withdrew from the
council and the city, and renounced their citizenship.
"Berne stumbled," said Haller, "but has risen up again
with greater strength than ever." This firmness in the
Bernese made a deep impression in Switzerland.<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ZWINGLE'S EXULTATION.</div>

<p>But the results of the conference at Baden were not
limited to Basle and Berne. While these events were
taking place in these powerful cities, a movement, more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
less similar, was going on in several other states of the
confederation. The preachers of St. Gall, on their return
from Baden, proclaimed the Gospel;<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> the images were removed
from the parochial church of St. Lawrence after a
conference, and the inhabitants sold their costly garments,
their jewels, rings, and gold chains, to found almshouses.
The Reformation despoiled, but it was to clothe the poor;
and the spoils were those of the reformed themselves.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

<p>At Mulhausen the Gospel was preached with fresh courage;
Thurgovia and the Rheinthal daily approximated
more and more to Zurich. Immediately after the disputation,
Zurzach removed the images from its churches, and
almost the whole district of Baden received the Gospel.</p>

<p>Nothing was better calculated to show which party had
really triumphed; and hence Zwingle, as he looked around
him, gave glory to God. "We have been attacked in
many ways," said he, "but the Lord is not only above their
threats, but also the wars themselves. In the city and
canton of Zurich there is an admirable agreement in favour
of the Gospel. We shall overcome all things by prayers
offered up with faith."<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> And shortly after, addressing
Haller, Zwingle said: "Everything here below has its
course. The rude north wind is followed by the gentle
breeze. After the scorching heat of summer, autumn pours
forth its treasures. And now, after severe contests, the
Creator of all things, whom we serve, has opened a way
for us into the camp of our adversaries. At last we may
welcome among us the christian doctrine, that dove so long
repulsed, and which ceased not to watch for the hour of her
return. Be thou the Noah to receive and save her."</p>

<p>This same year, Zurich had made an important acquisition.
Conrad Pellican, superior of the Franciscans at Basle,
professor of divinity at the age of twenty-four, had been
invited, through Zwingle's exertions, to be Hebrew professor
at Zurich. "I have long since renounced the pope," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
he on arriving, "and desired to live to Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>
Pellican, by his critical talents, became one of the most
useful labourers in the work of the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIET AT ZURICH&mdash;THE SMALLER CANTONS.</div>

<p>Zurich, still excluded from the diet by the Romish cantons,
wishing to take advantage of the more favourable disposition
manifested by some of the confederates, convened, in
the beginning of 1527, a diet to be held in Zurich itself.
The deputies of Berne, Basle, Schaffhausen, Appenzell, and
St. Gall attended it. "We desire," said the deputies of
Zurich, "that the Word of God, which leads us solely to
Christ crucified, should be the only thing preached, taught,
and exalted. We abandon all human doctrines, whatever
may have been the custom of our forefathers; being assured
that had they possessed this light of the Divine Word
which we enjoy, they would have embraced it with more
reverence than we their feeble descendants have done."<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>
The deputies present promised to take the representations of
Zurich into consideration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONSERVATIVE TENDENCY.</div>

<p>Thus the breach in the walls of Rome was widened daily.
The discussion at Baden had been intended to repair it; and
from that time, on the contrary, the wavering cantons seemed
willing to walk with Zurich. Already the inhabitants of the
plain inclined towards the Reformation; already it was hemming
in the mountains; already it was invading them, and
the primitive cantons, which were as the cradle, and are still
the citadel, of Switzerland, shut up in their higher Alps,
seemed alone to adhere firmly to the doctrine of their sires.
These mountaineers, continually exposed to violent storms,
to avalanches, to overflowing torrents and rivers, are compelled
all their lives to struggle against these formidable
enemies, and to sacrifice everything to preserve the meadow
in which their herds graze, and the cottage where they shelter
themselves from the storms, and which the first inundation
sweeps away. Accordingly the conservative principle
is strongly developed in them, and transmitted from age to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
age, from generation to generation. To preserve what they
have received from their fathers constitutes the whole wisdom
of these mountains. These rude Helvetians were then struggling
against the Reformation, which aimed at changing their
faith and their worship, as they struggle to this day against
the torrents that fall in thunder from their snowy peaks, or
against the new political ideas that have been established
at their very doors in the surrounding cantons. They will
be the last to lay down their arms before that twofold power
which already raises its banners on all the hills around, and
threatens daily and more nearly these conservative districts.</p>

<p>Accordingly these cantons, at the period which I am recording,
still more irritated against Berne than against Zurich,
and trembling lest this powerful state should desert
them, assembled their deputies in Berne itself a week after
the conference at Zurich. They called on the council to depose
the new teachers, to prosecute their doctrines, and to
maintain the ancient and true christian faith, as confirmed
by past ages and confessed by the martyrs. "Convoke all
the bailiwicks of the canton," added they; "if you refuse,
we will take it upon ourselves." The Bernese replied with
irritation: "We have power enough ourselves to speak to
those under our jurisdiction."</p>

<p>This reply only increased the anger of the Forest Cantons,
and these cantons, which had been the cradle of the political
freedom of Switzerland, alarmed at the progress of religious
liberty, began to seek, even from without, for allies to
destroy it. To combat the enemies of foreign service, that
foreign service might reasonably be resorted to; and if the
oligarchy of Switzerland could not suffice alone, was it not
natural to have recourse to the princes, their allies? In fact,
Austria, who had found it impossible to maintain her own
authority in the confederation, was ready to interfere to
strengthen the power of Rome. Berne learnt with dismay
that Ferdinand, brother of Charles V., was making preparations
against Zurich and all those who adhered to the Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CRITICAL MOMENT.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>Circumstances were becoming more critical. A succession
of events, more or less unfortunate, the excesses of the fanatics,
the disputes with Luther on the Eucharist, and
others besides, appear to have seriously compromised the
Reformation in Switzerland. The discussion at Baden had
disappointed the hopes of the papal party, and the sword
they had brandished against their adversaries had broken in
their hands; but this had only increased their vexation and
anger, and they were preparing for a fresh effort. Already
the imperial power itself was beginning to move; and the
Austrian bands which had been routed in the defiles of Morgarten
and on the heights of Sempach, were ready to enter
Switzerland with colours flying, to re-establish the tottering
power of Rome. The moment was critical; it was no longer
possible to halt between two opinions, and be neither "muddy
nor clear." Berne and other cantons, which had long hesitated,
were now to come to a decision. They must either
promptly return to the papacy, or take their stand with fresh
courage under the banners of Christ.</p>

<p>A Frenchman from the mountains of Dauphiny, William
Farel by name, at this time gave a powerful impulse to
Switzerland, decided the Reformation of Roman Helvetia,
still immersed in deep slumber, and thus turned the balance
throughout the whole confederation in favour of the new
doctrines. Farel arrived on the field of battle like those
fresh troops which, when the issue of the contest hangs
in the balance, rush into the thickest of the fight and
decide the victory. He prepared the way in Switzerland for
another Frenchman, whose austere faith and commanding
genius were to put a finishing hand to the Reformation, and
make the work complete. By means of these illustrious men,
France took her part in that vast commotion which agitated
christian society. It is now time that we should turn our
eyes towards that country.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Universality of Christianity&mdash;Enemies of the Reform in France&mdash;Heresy
and Persecution in Dauphiny&mdash;A country Mansion&mdash;The Farel Family&mdash;Pilgrimage
to the Holy Cross&mdash;Immorality and Superstition&mdash;William

<div class="sidenote">UNIVERSALITY OF CHRISTIANITY.</div>

<p>Universality is one of the essential characteristics of Christianity.
It is not so with human religions. They are
adapted to a certain people, and to the degree of cultivation
they have attained; they keep these nations stationary, or
if by any extraordinary circumstance the people attain a
fuller growth, their religion is left behind, and by that means
becomes useless to them.</p>

<p>There has been an Egyptian, a Grecian, a Latin, and even
a Jewish religion; Christianity is the only religion of mankind.</p>

<p>Its starting point in man is sin; and this is a characteristic
not peculiar to any one race, but is the heritage of every
human being. Hence the Gospel, as satisfying the universal
and most elevated wants of our nature, is received as coming
from God by the most barbarous and by the most civilized
nations. It does not, like the religions of antiquity, deify
national peculiarities; but it does not destroy them as modern
cosmopolitism would do. It does better; it sanctifies, ennobles,
and raises them to a holy unity by the new and
living principle it communicates to them.</p>

<p>The introduction of Christianity into the world has wrought
a great revolution in history. Until then, there had only
been a history of nations; now there is a history of mankind;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
and the idea of a universal education of the human
race, accomplished by Jesus Christ, has become the historian's
compass, the clue to history, and the hope of the
nations.</p>

<p>But Christianity exerts its influence not only on all nations,
but also on every period of their history.</p>

<p>At the moment of its appearance, the world was like a
torch about to become extinct, and Christianity rekindled it
with fire from heaven.</p>

<p>Subsequently, the barbarian tribes, having rushed upon
the Roman empire, had shattered and confounded every
thing; and Christianity, stemming that desolating torrent
with the cross, subdued by it the savage children of the
north, and gave society a new form.</p>

<p>Yet an element of corruption already lay hid in the religion
carried by courageous missionaries to those barbarous
tribes. Their faith came from Rome almost as much as
from the Bible. This element soon gathered strength; man
everywhere substituted himself for God,&mdash;the essential characteristic
of the Romish church; and a renovation of religion
became necessary. This Christianity accomplished at the
epoch of which we are treating.</p>

<p>The history of the Reformation in the countries that we
have hitherto surveyed has shown us the new doctrine rejecting
the extravagances of enthusiasts and of the
new prophets; but in the country towards which we now
turn our attention, infidelity is the shoal which it has to
encounter. Nowhere had bolder protests been made against
the superstitions and abuses of the Church: nowhere had
there been a more striking development of a certain love of
learning, independent of Christianity, which often ends in
irreligion. France carried in her bosom two reformations at
the same time,&mdash;the one of man, the other of God. "Two
nations were in her womb, and two manner of people were
to be separated from her bowels."<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ENEMIES OF THE REFORM IN FRANCE.</div>

<p>In France, the Reformation had to combat not only with
infidelity as well as superstition, but there was a third antagonist
which it had not yet encountered, at least in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
force, among the people of German origin: this was immorality.
The scandals in the Church were very great;
debauchery sat on the throne of Francis I. and Catherine
de Medicis; and the austere virtues of the reformers irritated
these "Sardanapaluses."<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> Everywhere, no doubt, but especially
in France, the Reformation was of necessity not only
doctrinal and ecclesiastical, but moral also.</p>

<p>Those violent enemies which the Reformation encountered
simultaneously in France, gave it a character altogether
peculiar. Nowhere did it so often dwell in dungeons, or so
much resemble primitive Christianity in faith, in charity,
and in the number of its martyrs. If, in the countries of
which we have hitherto spoken, the Reformation was more
glorious by its triumphs, in that which is now to engage
our attention, it was still more so by its defeats. If elsewhere
it could point to thrones and sovereign councils,
here it might point to scaffolds and "hill-side" meetings.
Whoever knows what constitutes the true glory of
Christianity upon earth, and the features that assimilate it
to its Head, will study with a livelier feeling of respect and
love the often blood-stained history that we now proceed to
relate.</p>

<p>The majority of the men who have afterwards glittered
on the stage of the world were born in the provinces where
their minds first began to expand. Paris is a tree that presents
many flowers and fruits to the eye, but whose roots
spread far and wide into the bosom of the earth, to draw
from thence the nutritious juices which they transform.
The Reformation also followed this law.</p>

<p>The Alps, which beheld bold and christian men spring up
in every canton and almost in every valley of Switzerland,
were destined in France also to cover with their lengthened
shadows the infancy of some of the first reformers.
For ages they had guarded the treasure more or less pure
in their high valleys, among the inhabitants of the Piedmontese
districts of Luzerne, Angrogne, and La Peyrouse.
The truth, which Rome could not reach there, had spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
from these valleys to the other side of these mountains, and
along their base to Provence and Dauphiny.</p>

<p>The year after the accession of Charles VIII., son of
Louis XI., a sickly and timid child, Innocent VIII. had
assumed the pontifical tiara (1484). He had seven or eight
sons by different mothers; and hence, according to an epigram
of the times, Rome unanimously saluted him with the
name of Father.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HERESY AND PERSECUTIONS IN DAUPHINY.</div>

<p>There was at that time on all the slopes of the Dauphinese
Alps, and along the banks of the Durance, a new growth
of the old Waldensian opinions. "The roots," says an old
chronicler, "were continually putting forth new shoots in
every direction."<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> Bold men called the Roman Church the
church of devils, and maintained that it was as profitable
to pray in a stable as in a church.</p>

<p>The priests, the bishops, and the Roman legates uttered a
cry of alarm, and on the 5th kalends of May (27th April)
1487, Innocent VIII., the father of the Romans, issued a
bull against these humble Christians. "To arms," said
the pontiff, "and trample these heretics under foot as venomous
serpents."<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></p>

<p>At the approach of the legate, followed by an army of
eighteen thousand men and a number of volunteers, who
wished to share the spoils of the Waldenses, the latter
abandoned their houses and took refuge in the mountains,
caverns, and clefts of the rocks, as the birds flee for shelter
when the storm begins to lower. Not a valley, nor a wood,
nor a rock, escaped their persecutors; everywhere in this
part of the Alps, and particularly on the Italian side, these
poor disciples of Christ were hunted down like beasts of prey.
At last the pope's satellites were worn out; their strength
was exhausted, their feet could no longer scale the steep retreats
of the "heretics," and their arms refused to strike.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL'S BIRTHPLACE AND FAMILY.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>In these alpine districts, then disturbed by Romish fanaticism,
three leagues from the ancient town of Gap,<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> in the
direction of Grenoble, not far from the flowery turf that
clothes the table-land of Bayard's mountain, at the foot of
the Aiguille and near the pass of Glaize, towards the place
where the Buzon takes its rise, stood and still stands a
group of houses, half hidden by the surrounding trees, and
which bears the name of Farel,&mdash;or, in the dialect of the
country, Fareau.<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> On an extensive terrace raised above
the neighbouring cottages might be seen a house of that
class which is denominated <i>Gentilhommière</i>, a manor-house.
It was surrounded by an orchard which led to the village.
Here, in these days of trouble, dwelt a noble family of established
piety, known by the name of Farel.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> In 1489, the
very year in which the papacy was employing its severest
measures in Dauphiny, was born in this modest mansion a
son who received the name of William. Three brothers,
Daniel, Walter, and Claude, and one sister, grew up with
William, and shared his sports on the banks of the Buzon
and at the foot of the Bayard.</p>

<p>There William's childhood and early youth were passed.
His parents were among the most devoted servants of the
papacy. "My father and mother believed everything," he
tells us himself;<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> "and accordingly they brought up their
children in all the observances of Romish devotion."</p>

<div class="sidenote">PILGRIMAGE TO THE HOLY CROSS.</div>

<p>God had bestowed rare qualities on William Farel, such
as were fitted to give him a great ascendency over his fellows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Possessing a penetrating mind and lively imagination,
sincere and upright, having a greatness of soul that
never allowed him, at whatever risk, to betray the convictions
of his heart, he was remarkable also for ardour, fire,
indomitable courage, and daring, which never shrunk from
any obstacle. But, at the same time, he had all the defects
allied to these qualities; and his parents were often compelled
to check his impetuosity.</p>

<p>William threw himself with his whole soul into the superstitious
habits of his credulous family. "I am horror-struck,"
said he, "when I consider the hours, the prayers,
and the divine honours, which I myself have offered and
caused others to offer to the cross and other such things."<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a></p>

<p>Four leagues to the south of Gap, near Tallard, in a hill
that rises above the impetuous stream of the Durance, was
a place in great repute, named Sainte Croix (the holy cross).
William was only seven or eight years old when his father
and mother resolved to take him thither on a pilgrimage.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>
"The cross in that place," they told him, "is made of the
very wood on which Christ was crucified."</p>

<p>The family began their journey, and at last reached the
highly venerated cross, before which they all fell prostrate.
After gazing for a time on the sacred wood and the copper
of the cross, the latter being made (as the priest told them)
of the basin in which Christ washed his apostles' feet, the
pilgrims turned their eyes to a small crucifix attached to the
cross: "When the devils send us hail and thunder," continued
the priest, "this crucifix moves about so violently,
that it seems to get loose from the cross, as if desirous of
running at the devil, and it continues throwing out sparks of
fire against the storm; if it were not for this, nothing would
be left upon earth."<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

<p>The pious pilgrims were deeply moved by the account of
these wonderful prodigies. "No one," continued the priest,
"sees or knows aught of these things except myself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
this man." The pilgrims turned their heads, and saw a
strange-looking person standing near them. "It was frightful
to look at him," said Farel.<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> White scales covered the
pupils of his eyes, "whether they were there in reality, or
Satan only made them appear so." This extraordinary man,
whom the incredulous denominated "the priest's wizard,"
on being appealed to by the latter, immediately replied that
the prodigy was true.<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">IMMORALITY AND SUPERSTITION.</div>

<p>A new episode completed the picture by mingling a suspicion
of criminal disorders with these superstitions. "There
came up a young woman, intent on other devotion than
that of the cross, carrying her infant wrapped in a cloth.
Then the priest went up, took hold of the woman and child,
and led them into the chapel. I may safely assert, that
never did dancer take a woman and lead her out more lovingly
than these two did. But such was our blindness, that
neither their looks nor their gestures, even when they had
behaved in an unseemly manner before us, appeared otherwise
than good and holy. It was clear that the woman and
my gallant of a priest understood the miracle thoroughly,
and made it a cover to their intercourse."<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<p>Such is a faithful picture of religion and morals in France
at the commencement of the Reformation. Morality and
belief were alike poisoned, and both required a powerful renovation.
The greater the value attached to external works,
the farther men were removed from sanctification of heart;
dead ordinances had been everywhere substituted for a
christian life, and a strange but not unnatural union had
taken place between the most scandalous debauchery and
the most superstitious devotion. Theft had been committed
before the altar, seduction practised in the confessional,
poison mingled with the consecrated elements, adultery
perpetrated at the foot of the cross. Superstition, by destroying
belief, had destroyed morality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WILLIAM DESIRES TO STUDY.</div>

<p>There were, however, numerous exceptions in the Christianity
of the middle ages. Even a superstitious faith might
be sincere, and of this William Farel is an example. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
same zeal that afterwards urged him to travel to so many different
places to spread the knowledge of Jesus Christ was at
this time attracting him wherever the Church exhibited a
miracle or claimed any adoration. Dauphiny had its seven
wonders, which long possessed the power of striking the
imagination of the people.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> But the beauties of nature that
surrounded him had also their influence in raising his soul
to the Creator.</p>

<p>The magnificent chain of the Alps, those summits covered
with eternal snow,&mdash;those vast rocks, here rearing their sharp
peaks to heaven, there stretching their immense and jagged
ridges high above the clouds, as if an island was suspended
in the air;&mdash;all these wonders of creation, which were
at this time elevating the soul of Ulrich Zwingle in the
Tockenburg, were appealing also in mute but powerful language
to the heart of William Farel among the mountains
of Dauphiny. He thirsted for life, for knowledge, and for
light;&mdash;he aspired to be something great;&mdash;he asked permission
to study.</p>

<p>This was a great blow to his father, who thought that a
young noble ought to know nothing beyond his rosary and
his sword. At this time fame was trumpeting the prowess
of a young countryman of William Farel's, a Dauphinese
like himself, named Du Terrail, but better known as Bayard,
who at the battle of the Tar, on the other side of the
Alps, had just given a signal display of courage. "Such
sons," it was observed, "are like arrows in the hand of a
strong man. Blessed is the man that hath his quiver full of
them!" Accordingly, Farel's father opposed the taste which
William manifested for learning. But the young man was
not to be shaken. God destined him for nobler conquests
than those of Bayard. He persevered in his entreaties, and
the old gentleman gave way at last.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a></p>

<p>Farel immediately applied to study with surprising ardour.
The masters whom he found in Dauphiny were of little help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
to him, and he had to contend with bad methods and the incapability
of his teachers.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> These difficulties excited instead
of discouraging him, and he soon surmounted these obstacles.
His brothers followed his example. Daniel afterwards
entered on the career of politics, and was employed in
important negotiations concerning religion.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> Walter gained
the entire confidence of the Count of Furstemberg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL GOES TO PARIS.</div>

<p>Farel, eager in the pursuit of knowledge, having learnt all
that could be acquired in his province, turned his eyes elsewhere.
The renown of the university of Paris had long filled
the christian world. He desired to see "this mother of all
learning, this true lamp of the Church which never knew
eclipse, that clear and polished mirror of the faith, dimmed
by no cloud, and spotted by no touch."<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> He obtained the

<div class="sidenote">LOUIS XII.&mdash;FRANCIS AND MARGARET.</div>

<p>One day in the year 1510, or shortly after, the young Dauphinese
arrived in Paris. The province had made him an
ardent follower of the papacy; the capital was to make him
something very different. In France the Reformation was
not destined to go forth, as in Germany, from a small city.
All the movements that agitate the people proceed from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
metropolis. A concurrence of providential circumstances
made Paris, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, a focus
whence a spark of life might easily escape. The young
man from the neighbourhood of Gap, who arrived there
humble and ignorant, was to receive that spark in his heart,
and many others with him.</p>

<p>Louis XII., the father of his people, had just convoked
the representatives of the French clergy to meet at Tours.
This prince seems to have anticipated the times of the Reformation;
so that had this great revolution taken place
during his reign, the whole of France might have become
protestant. The assembly of Tours had declared that the
king possessed the right of waging war on the pope, and of enforcing
the decrees of the Council of Basle. These measures
were the object of general conversation in the colleges, the city,
and the court; and must have made a deep impression on the
mind of young Farel.</p>

<p>Two children were then growing up in the court of Louis
XII. One was a prince of tall stature, striking features,
who showed little moderation in his character, and followed
blindly wherever his passions led him; so that the king was
in the habit of saying: "That great boy will spoil all."<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>
This was Francis of Angoulême, duke of Valois, and cousin
to the king. Boisy, his tutor, had taught him, however, to
honour literature.</p>

<p>By the side of Francis was his sister Margaret, his senior
by two years, "a princess," says Brantôme, "of great mind
and ability, both natural and acquired."<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> Accordingly,
Louis had spared no pains in her education, and the most
learned men in the kingdom hastened to acknowledge her as
their patroness.</p>

<p>Already, indeed, a group of illustrious men surrounded
these two Valois. William Bud&oelig;us, a man giving the run to
his passions, fond of the chase, living only for his hawks, his
horses, and his hounds, on a sudden, at the age of twenty-three,
had stopped short, sold his hunting train, and applied
himself to study with the zeal he had formerly displayed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
scouring the fields and forests with his dogs;<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> the physician
Cop, Francis Vatable, whose knowledge of Hebrew was
admired by the Jews themselves; James Tusan, a celebrated
Hellenist; and many others, encouraged by Stephen Poncher,
bishop of Paris, by Louis Ruzé, the civil lieutenant,
and by Francis de Luynes, and already protected by the two
young Valois, resisted the violent attacks of the Sorbonne, who
looked upon the study of Greek and Hebrew as the most
deadly heresy. At Paris, as in Germany and Switzerland,
the restoration of sound doctrine was to be preceded by
the revival of letters. But in France the hands that thus
prepared the materials were not destined to construct the
edifice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEARNED MEN&mdash;LEFEVRE.</div>

<p>Among all the doctors who then adorned the capital, was
observed a man of very diminutive stature, of mean appearance,
and humble origin,<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> whose intellect, learning, and
powerful eloquence had an indefinable attraction for all who
heard him. His name was Lefevre; and he was born about
1455 at Etaples, a village in Picardy. He had received
a rude, or as Theodore Beza calls it, a barbarous education;
but his genius had supplied the want of masters; and his
piety, learning, and nobility of soul, shone out with so much
the brighter lustre. He had travelled much, and it would
appear that his desire of acquiring knowledge had led him into
Asia and Africa.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> As early as 1493, Lefevre, then doctor
of divinity, was professor in the university of Paris. He
immediately occupied a distinguished rank, and, in the estimation
of Erasmus, was the first.<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LECTURES AT THE UNIVERSITY.</div>

<p>Lefevre saw that he had a task to perform. Although
attached to the practices of the Romish Church, he resolved
to attack the barbarism then prevailing in the university;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>
he began to teach the various branches of philosophy with a
clearness hitherto unknown. He endeavoured to revive the
study of languages and learned antiquity. He went farther
than this; he perceived that, as regards a work of regeneration,
philosophy and learning are insufficient. Abandoning,
therefore, scholasticism, which for so many ages had reigned
supreme in the schools, he returned to the Bible, and revived
in Christendom the study of the Holy Scriptures and evangelical
learning. He did not devote his time to dry researches,
he went to the heart of the Bible. His eloquence, his candour,
his amiability, captivated all hearts. Serious and fervent
in the pulpit, he indulged in a sweet familiarity with
his pupils. "He loves me exceedingly," wrote Glarean, one
of their number, to his friend Zwingle. "Full of candour and
kindness, he often sings, prays, disputes, and laughs at the
follies of the world with me."<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> Accordingly, a great number
of disciples from every country sat at his feet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL'S DEVOTION TO THE POPE.</div>

<p>This man, with all his learning, submitted with the simplicity
of a child to every observance of the Church. He
passed as much time in the churches as in his study, so that
a close union seemed destined to unite the aged doctor of
Picardy and the young scholar of Dauphiny. When two
natures so similar as these meet together, though it be within
the wide circuit of a capital, they tend to draw near each
other. In his pious pilgrimages, young Farel soon noticed
an aged man, and was struck by his devotion. He prostrated
himself before the images, and remained long on
his knees, praying with fervour and devoutly repeating his
hours. "Never," said Farel, "never had I seen a chanter of
the mass sing it with greater reverence."<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> This man was
Lefevre. William Farel immediately desired to become acquainted
with him; and could not restrain his joy when
he found himself kindly received by this celebrated man.
William had gained his object in coming to the capital.
From that time his greatest pleasure was to converse with
the doctor of Etaples, to listen to him, to hear his admirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
lessons, and to kneel with him devoutly before the same
shrines. Often might the aged Lefevre and his young disciple
be seen adorning an image of the Virgin with flowers;
and alone, far from all Paris, far from its scholars and its
doctors, they murmured in concert the fervent prayers they
offered up to Mary.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a></p>

<p>Farel's attachment to Lefevre was noticed by many. The
respect felt towards the old doctor was reflected on his
young disciple. This illustrious friendship drew the Dauphinese
from his obscurity. He soon acquired a reputation
for zeal; and many devout rich persons in Paris intrusted
him with various sums of money intended for the support of
the poorer students.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a></p>

<p>Some time elapsed ere Lefevre and his disciple arrived at
a clear perception of the truth. It was not the hope of a
rich benefice or a propensity to a dissolute life which bound
Farel to the pope; those vulgar ties were not made for
souls like his. To him the pope was the visible head of the
Church, a sort of deity, by whose commandments souls
might be saved. Whenever he heard any one speaking
against this highly venerated pontiff, he would gnash his
teeth like a furious wolf, and would have called down
lightning from heaven "to overwhelm the guilty wretch
with utter ruin and confusion."&mdash;"I believe," said he, "in
the cross, in pilgrimages, images, vows, and relics. What
the priest holds in his hands, puts into the box, and there
shuts it up, eats, and gives others to eat, is my only true
God, and to me there is no other, either in heaven or upon
earth."<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>&mdash;"Satan," says he in another place, "had so lodged
the pope, the papacy, and all that is his in my heart, that
even the pope had not so much of it in himself."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HESITATION AND INQUIRY&mdash;FIRST AWAKENING.</div>

<p>Thus, the more Farel appeared to seek God, the more his
piety decayed and superstition increased in his soul; everything
was going from bad to worse. He has himself described
this condition in energetic language:<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> "Alas! how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
I shudder at myself and at my faults," said he, "when I
think upon it; and how great and wonderful a work of God
it is, that man should ever have been dragged from such an
abyss!"</p>

<p>From this abyss he emerged only by degrees. He had at
first studied the profane authors; his piety finding no food
there, he began to meditate on the lives of the saints; infatuated
as he was before, these legends only made him
still more so.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> He then attached himself to several doctors
of the age; but as he had gone to them in wretchedness, he
left them more wretched still. At last he began to study
the ancient philosophers, and expected to learn from Aristotle
how to be a Christian; again his hopes were disappointed.
Books, images, relics, Aristotle, Mary, and the saints&mdash;all
proved unavailing. His ardent soul wandered from one
human wisdom to another, without finding the means of
allaying its burning thirst.</p>

<p>Meantime the pope, allowing the writings of the Old and
New Testaments to be called <i>The Holy Bible</i>, Farel began
to read them, as Luther had done in the cloister at Erfurth;
he was amazed<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> at seeing that everything upon earth was
different from what is taught in the Scriptures. Perhaps he
was on the point of reaching the truth, but on a sudden a
thicker darkness plunged him into another abyss. "Satan
came suddenly upon me," said he, "that he might not lose
his prize, and dealt with me according to his custom."<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> A
terrible struggle between the Word of God and the word of
the Church then took place in his heart. If he met with
any passages of Scripture opposed to the Romish practices,
he cast down his eyes, blushed, and dared not believe what
he read.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> "Alas!" said he, fearing to keep his looks fixed on
the Bible, "I do not well understand these things; I must
give a very different meaning to the Scriptures from that
which they seem to have. I must keep to the interpretation
of the Church, and indeed of the pope."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PANTHEON&mdash;LEFEVRE'S PROPHECY.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>One day, as he was reading the Bible, a doctor who happened
to come in rebuked him sharply. "No man," said
he, "ought to read the Holy Scriptures before he has learnt
philosophy and taken his degree in arts." This was a preparation
the apostles had not required; but Farel believed
him. "I was," says he, "the most wretched of men, shutting
my eyes lest I should see."<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p>From that time the young Dauphinese had a return to his
Romish fervour. The legends of the saints inflamed his
imagination. The greater the severity of the monastic rules,
the greater was the attraction he felt towards them. In the
midst of the woods near Paris, some Carthusians inhabited
a group of gloomy cells; he visited them with reverence,
and shared in their austerities. "I was wholly employed,
day and night, in serving the devil," said he, "after the
fashion of that man of sin, the pope. I had my Pantheon
in my heart, and such a troop of mediators, saviours, and
gods, that I might well have passed for a papal register."</p>

<p>The darkness could not grow deeper; the morning star
was soon to arise, and it was destined to appear at Lefevre's
voice. There were already some gleams of light in
the doctor of Etaples; an inward conviction told him that
the Church could not long remain in its actual position; and
often, at the very moment of his return from saying mass,
or of rising from before some image, the old man would turn
towards his youthful disciple, and grasping him by the hand
would say in a serious tone of voice: "My dear William,
God will renew the world, and you will see it!"<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> Farel did
not thoroughly understand these words. Yet Lefevre did not
confine himself to this mysterious language; a great change
which was then wrought in him, was destined to produce a
similar effect on his disciple.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LEGENDS AND THE WORD OF GOD.</div>

<p>The old doctor was engaged in a laborious task; he was
carefully collecting the legends of the saints and martyrs,
and arranging them according to the order in which their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
names are found in the calendar. Two months had already
been printed, when one of those beams of light which come
from heaven, suddenly illuminated his soul. He could not
resist the disgust which such puerile superstitions must ever
cause in the heart of a Christian. The sublimity of the
Word of God made him perceive the paltry nature of these
fables. They now appeared to him no better than "brimstone
fit to kindle the fire of idolatry."<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> He abandoned his
work, and throwing these legends aside, turned ardently
towards the Holy Scriptures. At the moment when Lefevre,
quitting the wondrous tales of the saints, laid his hand on
the Word of God, a new era began in France, and is the
commencement of the Reformation.</p>

<p>In effect, Lefevre, weaned from the fables of the Breviary,
began to study the Epistles of St. Paul; the light increased
rapidly in his heart, and he immediately imparted to his disciples
that knowledge of the truth which we find in his
commentaries.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> Strange doctrines were those for the school
and for the age, which were then first heard in Paris, and
disseminated by the press throughout the christian world.
We may easily understand that the young disciples who
listened to them were aroused, impressed, and changed by
them; and that thus, prior to the year 1512, the dawn of a
brighter day was preparing for France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH&mdash;OBJECTIONS.</div>

<p>The doctrine of justification by faith, which overthrew by
a single blow the subtleties of the schoolmen and the observances
of popery, was boldly proclaimed in the bosom of
the Sorbonne. "It is God alone," said the doctor, and the
vaulted roofs of the university must have been astonished as
they re-echoed such strange sounds, "it is God alone, who
by his grace, through faith, justifies unto everlasting life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>
There is a righteousness of works, there is a righteousness
of grace; the one cometh from man, the other from God;
one is earthly and passeth away, the other is heavenly and
eternal; one is the shadow and the sign, the other the light
and the truth; one makes sin known to us that we may
escape death, the other reveals grace that we may obtain
life."<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></p>

<p>"What then!" asked his hearers, as they listened to this
teaching, which contradicted that of four centuries; "has
any one man been ever justified without works?" "One!"
answered Lefevre, "they are innumerable. How many
people of disorderly lives, who have ardently prayed for the
grace of baptism, possessing faith alone in Christ, and who,
if they died the moment after, have entered into the life of
the blessed without works!"&mdash;"If, therefore, we are not justified
by works, it is in vain that we perform them," replied
some. The Paris doctor answered, and the other reformers
would not perhaps have altogether approved of this reply:
"Certainly not! they are not in vain. If I hold a mirror to
the sun, its image is reflected; the more I polish and clear
it, the brighter is the reflection; but if we allow it to become
tarnished, the splendour of the sun is dimmed. It is the
same with justification in those who lead an impure life."
In this passage, Lefevre, like Augustine in many, does not
perhaps make a sufficient distinction between sanctification
and justification. The doctor of Etaples reminds us strongly
of the Bishop of Hippona. Those who lead an unholy life
have never received justification, and therefore cannot lose it.
But Lefevre may have intended to say that the Christian,
when he has fallen into any sin, loses the assurance of salvation,
and not salvation itself. If so, there is no objection
to be made against his doctrine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISORDERS IN THE COLLEGES&mdash;UPROAR.</div>

<p>Thus a new life and a new teaching had penetrated into
the university of Paris. The doctrine of faith, formerly
preached in Gaul by Pothinus and Irenæus, was heard there
again. From this time there were two parties, two people
in this great school of Christendom. Lefevre's lessons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
the zeal of his disciples formed the most striking contrast
to the scholastic teaching of the majority of the doctors,
and the irregular and frivolous lives of most of the students.
In the colleges, they were far more busily engaged in learning
their parts in comedies, in masquerading, and in mountebank
farces, than in studying the oracles of God. In these
plays the honour of the great, of the princes, of the king
himself, was frequently attacked. The parliament interfered
about this period; and summoning the principals
of several colleges before them, forbade those indulgent
masters to permit such dramas to be represented in their
houses.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<p>But a more powerful diversion than the decrees of parliament
suddenly came to correct these disorders. Jesus Christ
was preached. Great was the uproar on the benches of the
university, and the students began to occupy themselves
almost as much with the evangelical doctrines as with the
quibbles of the school or with comedies. Many of those whose
lives were the least irreproachable, adhered however to the
doctrine of works; and feeling that the doctrine of faith condemned
their way of living, they pretended that St. James was
opposed to St. Paul. Lefevre, resolving to defend the treasure
he had discovered, showed the agreement of these two apostles:
"Does not St. James in his first chapter declare that every
good and perfect gift cometh down <i>from above</i>? Now, who
will deny that justification is the good and perfect gift?......If
we see a man moving, the respiration that we perceive is
to us a sign of life. Thus works are necessary, but only as
signs of a living faith, which is accompanied by justification.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>
Do eye-salves or lotions give light to the eye?......No! it is
the influence of the sun. Well, then, these lotions and these
eye-salves are our works. The ray that the sun darts from
above is justification itself."<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">EFFECTS ON FAREL&mdash;THE CROSS&mdash;ELECTION.</div>

<p>Farel listened earnestly to this teaching. These words of
salvation by grace had immediately an indescribable charm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
for him. Every objection fell: every struggle ceased. No
sooner had Lefevre put forward this doctrine than Farel embraced
it with all the ardour of his soul. He had undergone
labour and conflicts enough to be aware that he could not
save himself. Accordingly, immediately he saw in the Word
that God saves freely, he believed. "Lefevre," said he,
"extricated me from the false opinion of human merits, and
taught me that everything came from grace: which I believed
as soon as it was spoken."<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> Thus by a conversion as
prompt and decisive as that of St. Paul was Farel led to the
faith,&mdash;that Farel who (as Theodore Beza says), undismayed
by difficulties, threats, abuse, or blows, won over to Jesus
Christ Montbelliard, Neufchatel, Lausanne, Aigle, and finally
Geneva.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Lefevre, continuing his lessons, and delighting,
as Luther did, in employing contrasts and paradoxes containing
weighty truths, extolled the greatness of the mysteries
of redemption: "Ineffable exchange," exclaimed he, "the
innocent One is condemned and the criminal acquitted; the
Blessing is cursed, and he who was cursed is blessed; the
Life dies, and the dead live; the Glory is covered with shame,
and He who was put to shame is covered with glory."<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> The
pious doctor, going still deeper, acknowledged that all salvation
proceeds from the sovereignty of God's love. "Those
who are saved," said he, "are saved by election, by grace,
by the will of God, not by their own. Our own election,
will, and works, are of no avail: the election of God alone is
profitable. When we are converted, it is not our conversion
that makes us the elect of God, but the grace, will, and
election of God which convert us."<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SANCTIFICATION OF LIFE.</div>

<p>But Lefevre did not confine himself to doctrines alone: if
he gave to God the glory, he required obedience from man,
and urged the obligations which proceed from the great
privileges of the Christian. "If thou art a member of Christ's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Church, thou art also a member of his body," said he; "and
if thou art a member of Christ's body, thou art full of the
Divinity; for in him dwelleth the fulness of the Godhead
bodily. Oh! if men could but understand this privilege,
how chastely, purely, and holily would they live, and they
would look upon all the glory of this world as disgrace, in
comparison with that inner glory which is hidden from the
eyes of the flesh."<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>

<p>Lefevre perceived that the office of a teacher of the Word
is a lofty station; and he exercised it with unshaken
fidelity. The corruption of the times, and particularly that
of the clergy, excited his indignation, and became the subject
of severe rebuke. "How scandalous it is," said he, "to see a
bishop asking persons to drink with him, gambling, rattling
the dice, spending his time with hawks and dogs, and in
hunting, hallooing after rooks and deer, and frequenting
houses of ill-fame!<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>......O men deserving a severer punishment
than Sardanapalus himself!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Farel and the Saints&mdash;The University&mdash;Farel's Conversion&mdash;Farel and
Luther&mdash;Other Disciples&mdash;Date of the Reform in France&mdash;Spontaneous
Rise of the different Reforms&mdash;Which was the first?&mdash;Lefevre's Place.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">FAREL AND THE SAINTS&mdash;THE UNIVERSITY.</div>

<p>Thus taught Lefevre. Farel listened, trembling with emotion;
he received all, and rushed suddenly into the new path
that was opening before him. There was, however, one
point of his ancient faith which he could not as yet entirely
renounce; this was the invocation of saints. The best
spirits often have these relics of darkness, which they cling
to after their illumination. Farel was astonished as he
heard the illustrious doctor declare that Christ alone should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
be invoked. "Religion has but one foundation," said Lefevre,
"one object, one Head, Jesus Christ, blessed for evermore:
alone hath He trodden the wine-press. Let us not
then call ourselves after St. Paul, or Apollos, or St. Peter.
The cross of Christ alone openeth the gates of heaven, and
shutteth the gates of hell." When he heard these words, a
fierce conflict took place in Farel's soul. On the one hand,
he beheld the multitude of saints with the Church; on the
other, Jesus Christ alone with his master. Now he inclined to
one side, now to another; it was his last error and his last
battle. He hesitated, he still clung to those venerable men
and women at whose feet Rome falls in adoration. At length
the decisive blow was struck from above. The scales fell from
his eyes. Jesus alone appeared deserving of his worship.
"Then," said he, "popery was utterly overthrown; I began
to detest it as devilish, and the holy Word of God had the
chief place in my heart."<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<p>Public events accelerated the course of Farel and his
friends. Thomas de Vio, who afterwards contended with
Luther at Augsburg and at Leipsic, having advanced in one
of his works that the pope was the absolute monarch of the
Church, Louis XII. laid the book before the university in
the month of February 1512. James Allmain, one of the
youngest doctors, a man of profound genius and indefatigable
application, read before the faculty of theology a refutation
of the cardinal's assertions, which was received with
the greatest applause.<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PEACE AND JOY.</div>

<p>What impression must not such discourses have produced
on the minds of Lefevre's young disciples! Could they hesitate
when the university seemed impatient under the papal
yoke? If the main body itself was in motion, ought not they
to rush forward as skirmishers and clear the way? "It was
necessary," said Farel, "that popery should have fallen
little by little from my heart; for it did not tumble down at
the first shock."<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> He contemplated the abyss of superstitions
in which he had been plunged. Standing on the brink,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
he once more surveyed its depth with an anxious eye, and
shrunk back with a feeling of terror. "Oh! what horror
do I feel at myself and my sins, when I think of these
things!" exclaimed he.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> "O Lord," he continued, "would
that my soul had served thee with a living faith, as thy
obedient servants have done; would that it had prayed to and
honoured thee as much as I have given my heart to the mass
and to serve that enchanted wafer, giving it all honour!" In
such terms did the youthful Dauphinese deplore his past life,
and repeat in tears, as St. Augustine had done before: "I
have known Thee too late; too late have I loved Thee!"</p>

<p>Farel had found Jesus Christ; and having reached the
port, he was delighted to find repose after such terrible storms.<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>
"Now," said he, "every thing appears to me under a fresh
aspect.<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> Scripture is cleared up; prophecy is opened; the
apostles shed a strong light upon my soul.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> A voice, till
now unknown, the voice of Christ, my Shepherd, my Master,
my Teacher, speaks to me with power."<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> He was so changed
that, "instead of the murderous heart of a ravening wolf, he
came back," he tells us, "quietly, like a meek and harmless
lamb, having his heart entirely withdrawn from the pope, and
given to Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></p>

<p>Having escaped from so great an evil, he turned towards
the Bible,<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> and began to study Greek and Hebrew with much
earnestness.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> He read the Scriptures constantly, with ever
increasing affection, and God enlightened him from day to
day. He still continued to attend the churches of the established
worship; but what found he there? loud voices, interminable
chantings, and words spoken without understanding.<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>
Accordingly, when standing in the midst of a crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
that was passing near an image or an altar, he would exclaim,
"Thou alone art God! thou alone art wise! thou alone art
good!<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> Nothing must be taken away from thy holy law,
and nothing added. For thou alone art the Lord, and thou
alone wilt and must command."</p>

<p>Thus fell in his eyes all men and all teachers from the
height to which his imagination had raised them, and he
now saw nothing in the world but God and his Word. The
other doctors of Paris, by their persecutions of Lefevre, had
already fallen in his esteem; but erelong Lefevre himself,
his beloved guide, was no more than a man like himself.
He loved and venerated him still; but God alone became his
master.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL AND LUTHER.</div>

<p>Of all the reformers, Farel and Luther are perhaps those
whose early spiritual developments are best known to us, and
who had to pass through the greatest struggles. Quick and
ardent, men of conflict and strife, they underwent the severest
trials before attaining peace. Farel is the pioneer of the Reformation
in France and Switzerland; he rushes into the
wood, and hews down the aged giants of the forest with his
axe. Calvin came after, like Melancthon, from whom he
differs indeed in character, but whom he resembles in his
part as theologian and organizer. These two men, who
have something in common with the legislators of antiquity,&mdash;the
one in its graceful, the other in its severe style,&mdash;built
up, settled, and gave laws to the territory conquered by the
first two reformers. If, however, Luther and Farel approximate
in some of their features, we must acknowledge that
the latter resembles the Saxon reformer in one aspect only.
Besides his superior genius, Luther had, in all that concerned
the Church, a moderation and wisdom, an acquaintance with
the past, a comprehensive judgment, and even an organizing
faculty, that did not exist to the same degree in the Dauphinese
reformer.</p>

<p>Farel was not the only young Frenchman into whose
mind the new light then beamed. The doctrines that fell
from the lips of the illustrious doctor of Etaples fermented
among the crowd who listened to his lectures, and in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
school were trained the daring soldiers who, in the hour of
battle, were to contend even to the foot of the scaffold.
They listened, compared, discussed, and keenly argued on
both sides. It is probable that among the small number of
scholars who defended the truth was young Peter Robert
Olivetan, born at Noyon about the close of the fifteenth century,
who afterwards translated the Bible into French from
Lefevre's version, and who seems to have been the first to
draw the attention of a youth of his family, also a native of
Noyon, to the Gospel, and who became the most illustrious
chief of the Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DATE OF THE REFORM IN FRANCE.</div>

<p>Thus in 1512, at a time when Luther had made no impression
on the world, and was going to Rome on some
trifling monkish business,&mdash;at an epoch when Zwingle had
not yet begun to apply himself earnestly to sacred learning,
and was crossing the Alps with the confederates to fight for
the pope,&mdash;Paris and France were listening to the teaching of
those vital truths from which the Reformation was ordained
to issue; and souls prepared to disseminate them were
drinking them in with holy thirst. Hence Theodore Beza,
speaking of Lefevre, hails him as the man "who boldly
began the revival of the pure religion of Jesus Christ;"<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>
and remarks that, "as in ancient times the school of Isocrates
sent forth the best orators, so from the lecture-room
of the doctor of Etaples issued many of the best men of the
age and of the Church."<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SPONTANEOUS BIRTH OF REFORM.</div>

<p>The Reformation was not, therefore, in France a foreign
importation. It was born on French soil; it germinated
in Paris; it put forth its first shoots in the university itself,
that second authority in Romish Christendom. God planted
the seeds of this work in the simple hearts of a Picard and
a Dauphinese, before they had begun to bud forth in any
other country upon earth. The Swiss Reformation, as we
have seen,<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> was independent of the German Reformation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
and in its turn the Reformation in France was independent of
that of Switzerland and of Germany. The work commenced
at the same time in different countries, without any communication
one with the other; as in a battle all the divisions
begin to move at the same moment, although one has not
told the other to march, but because one and the same command,
issuing from a higher power, has been heard by all.
The time had come, the nations were prepared, and God was
everywhere beginning the revival of his Church at the same
time. Such facts demonstrate that the great revolution of
the sixteenth century was a work of God.</p>

<p>If we look only to dates, we must acknowledge that
neither to Switzerland nor to Germany belongs the honour of
having begun this work, although, hitherto, these two countries
alone have contended for it. This honour belongs to France.
This is a truth, a fact that we are anxious to establish, because
until now it may possibly have been overlooked.
Without dwelling on the influence that Lefevre exercised
directly or indirectly on many individuals, and in particular on
Calvin himself, as we conjecture, let us reflect on that which
he had on one only of his disciples,&mdash;on Farel, and on the
energetic activity which this servant of God manifested ever
afterwards. Can we, after that, resist the conviction, that
if Zwingle and Luther had never appeared, there would still
have been a reforming movement in France? It is impossible,
no doubt, to calculate what might have been its
extent; we must even acknowledge that the report of what
was taking place on the other side of the Rhine and the
Jura afterwards animated and accelerated the progress of the
French reformers. But they were the first awakened by the
trumpet that sounded from heaven in the sixteenth century,
and they were the first on foot and under arms upon the field
of battle.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Luther is the great workman of the sixteenth
century, and in the fullest sense the first reformer. Lefevre
is not so complete as Calvin, Farel, and Luther. He is of
Wittemberg and Geneva, but there is still a tinge of the
Sorbonne; he is the first catholic in the reform movement,
and the last of the reformers in the catholic movement. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
is to the end a sort of go-between, a mediator not altogether
free from mystery, destined to remind us of the connexion
between the old things and the new, which seemed for ever
separated by an impassable gulf. Though rejected and persecuted
by Rome, he still clings to Rome by a slender thread
which he has no desire to break. Lefevre of Etaples has a
station apart in the theology of the sixteenth century: he
is the link connecting the ancient times with the modern,
and the man in whom the transition is made from the theology
of the middle ages to the theology of the Reformation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Character of Francis I.&mdash;Commencement of Modern Times&mdash;Liberty
and Obedience&mdash;Margaret of Valois&mdash;The Court&mdash;Briçonnet, Count of
Montbrun&mdash;Lefevre commends him to the Bible&mdash;Francis I. and "his

Character.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF FRANCIS I.</div>

<p>Thus the whole university was in a state of restlessness.
But the Reformation in France was not to be a work of the
learned only. It was to take its place among the great ones
of the world, and even in the court of the sovereign.</p>

<p>The youthful Francis I. of Angoulême had succeeded
his father-in-law and cousin Louis XII. His beauty and
address, his courage and love of pleasure, made him the
first knight of his time. He aspired, however, at being
something more; he desired to be a great and even a good
king, provided everything would bend to his sovereign
pleasure. Valour, a taste for letters, and a love of gallantry,
are three terms that will express the character of Francis and
the spirit of his age. Two other illustrious kings, Henry
IV. and especially Louis XIV., presented the same features
in after-years. But these princes wanted what the Gospel
communicates; and although there had always existed in
the nation elements of holiness and christian elevation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
we may say that these three great monarchs of modern
France have in some measure stamped upon their subjects
the impress of their own peculiarities, or rather that they
themselves were the faithful images of the character of their
people. If the Gospel had entered France with the most
illustrious of the Valois family, it would have brought the
nation what it does not possess,&mdash;a spiritual tendency, a
christian holiness, a knowledge of divine things, and would
thus have perfected it in what constitutes the real strength
and greatness of a people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COMMENCEMENT OF MODERN TIMES.</div>

<p>It was in the reign of Francis I. that France and Europe
passed from the middle ages to modern times. The new
world, which was then in the bud, grew up and entered
into possession. Two classes of men imposed their influence
on the new state of society. On the one hand were
the men of faith, men also of wisdom and holiness; and
by their side were the courtly writers, friends of the world
and of vice, who by the freedom of their principles contributed
as much to the depravation of morals as the former to
their reformation.</p>

<p>If Europe in the days of Francis I. had not witnessed the
rise of the reformers, and had been handed over by the severe
judgment of Providence to the unbelieving innovators, her
fate and that of Christianity would have been decided. The
danger was great. For some time these two classes of combatants,
the antagonists of the pope and the opponents of
the Gospel, were mixed up together; and as they both
claimed liberty, they appeared to employ the same arms
against the same enemies. An unpractised eye could not
distinguish between them amid the dust and clouds of the
battle-field. If the former had allowed themselves to be
carried away by the latter, all would have been lost. The
enemies of the hierarchy were passing rapidly to the extremes
of impiety, and pushing christian society into a
frightful abyss; the papacy itself was helping towards this
terrible catastrophe, and accelerating by its ambition and its
disorders the destruction of the remnants of truth and life
still surviving in the Church. But God raised up the Reformation,
and Christianity was saved. The reformers who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
had shouted liberty, soon called for obedience. The very
men who had cast down the throne whence the Roman
pontiff issued his oracles, fell prostrate before the Word of
God. Then a clear and definite separation took place; nay
more, the two bodies engaged in war against each other.
The one party had desired liberty only for themselves, the
others had claimed it for the Word of God. The Reformation
became the most formidable enemy of that incredulity
towards which Rome is often so lenient. After restoring
liberty to the Church, the reformers restored religion to the
world. Of these two gifts, the latter was the most needed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARGARET OF VALOIS.</div>

<p>The friends of infidelity hoped, for a while, to reckon
among their number Margaret of Valois, duchess of Alençon,
whom Francis tenderly loved, and always called "<i>sa mignonne</i>,"
his darling, as we learn from Brantôme.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> The same
tastes, the same acquirements, distinguished both brother
and sister. Possessing, like Francis, a handsome person,
Margaret combined with those eminent qualities that make
great characters those gentler virtues that win the affections.
In the world, in the gay entertainments at the court
of the king and of the emperor, she shone like a queen, charming,
surprising, and captivating all hearts. Passionately
fond of letters, and endowed with a rare genius, she would
retire to her closet, and there indulge in the sweet pleasures
of thought, study, and learning. But her ruling passion
was to do good and prevent evil. When ambassadors had
been received by the king, they went and paid their respects
to Margaret. "They were mightily enchanted with her," says
Brantôme, "and made a glowing report of her to their own
countrymen." And the king would often refer matters of
importance to her, "leaving them solely to her decision."<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></p>

<p>This celebrated princess was distinguished for the strictness
of her morals; but while many confine this strictness to
their lips, and are lax in their behaviour, Margaret did the
contrary. Irreproachable in conduct, she was not altogether
free from censure in her writings. Instead of being surprised
at this, we might rather wonder that a woman so dissolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
as Louisa of Savoy should have a daughter so pure as Margaret.
While visiting different parts of the country with the
court, she amused herself with describing the manners of the
time, and particularly the disorders of the priests and monks.
"I have heard her," says Brantôme, "thus narrating tales
to my grandmother, who always accompanied her in her
litter, as lady-in-waiting, and who had charge of her
inkhorn."<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COURT&mdash;BRIÇONNET.</div>

<p>This Margaret, so beautiful, so full of wit, and living in
the atmosphere of a corrupted court, was one of the first to
be carried away by the religious movement then beginning
in France. But how could the Duchess of Alençon be
reached by the Reformation in the midst of so profane a
court, and of the licentious tales by which it was amused?
Her elevated soul felt wants that the Gospel alone could
satisfy; grace works everywhere; and Christianity, which
even before an apostle had appeared in Rome already counted
followers in the house of Narcissus and in the court of Nero,<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a>
penetrated rapidly, at the period of its renovation, into the court
of Francis I. High-bred dames and noble lords addressed
the princess in the language of faith; and that sun, then
rising upon France, shed its earliest beams upon an illustrious
head, by which they were immediately reflected on the
Duchess of Alençon.</p>

<p>Among the most distinguished noblemen at the court was
William of Montbrun, son of Cardinal Briçonnet of St. Malo,
who had entered the church after the decease of his wife.
Count William, who was fond of study, took holy orders,
and became successively bishop of Lodève and of Meaux.
Being twice sent ambassador to Rome, he returned to Paris,
unseduced by the flattery and pomps of Leo X.</p>

<p>At the period of his return to France, the sap was everywhere
beginning to move. Farel, then master of arts, was
lecturing in the celebrated college of the Cardinal Lemoine,
one of the four principal colleges of the theological faculty in
Paris, equal in rank to the Sorbonne. Two fellow-countrymen
of Lefevre, Arnaud and Gerard Roussel, with several others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
increased the circle of liberal and generous minds. Briçonnet,
fresh from the gay entertainments and festivities of
Rome, was astonished at what had taken place in Paris during
his absence. Thirsting for the truth, he renewed his
ancient relations with Lefevre, and passed many precious
hours with the doctor of the Sorbonne, with Farel, the two
Roussels and their friends.<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> This illustrious but humble-minded
prelate was willing to be instructed by the lowliest
Christians, but particularly by the Lord himself. "I am in
darkness," said he, "awaiting the grace of the Divine benevolence,
from which I am exiled by my demerits." His mind
was dazzled, as it were, by the brilliancy of the Gospel. His
eyelids drooped before its unequalled brightness. "The
eyes of all men," added he, "are insufficient to receive the
whole light of this great luminary."<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BRIÇONNET READS THE BIBLE.</div>

<p>Lefevre had recommended the bishop to the Bible; he had
pointed to it as the clue which ever leads men back to the
primitive truth of Christianity,&mdash;to what it was when schools,
sects, ordinances, and traditions were unknown, and as the
powerful medium by which the religion of Jesus Christ is
renovated. Briçonnet read the Bible. "Such is the sweetness
of this Divine food," said he, "that it makes the mind
insatiable; the more we taste of it, the more we long for it."<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>
The simple and mighty truth of salvation charmed him: he
found Christ,&mdash;he found God himself. "What vessel," said
he, "is able to receive the exceeding fulness of this inexhaustible
sweetness? But the dwelling extends according
to our desire to entertain the good guest. Faith is the
quartermaster who alone can find room for him, or, more
truly, who makes us dwell in him." But at the same time
the good bishop, afflicted at seeing this doctrine of life, which
the Reformation restored to the world, held in so little
estimation at court, in the city, and among the people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
exclaimed: "Oh singular and most worthy innovation, and
yet to my fellow-men most unacceptable!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRANCIS I. AND HIS CHILDREN.</div>

<p>It is in this way that evangelical opinions made their way
into the midst of the frivolous, dissolute, and literary court
of Francis I. Many of the men who composed it, and who
enjoyed the entire confidence of the king, as John du Bellay,
Budæus, Cop the court physician, and even Petit the king's
confessor, appeared favourably disposed towards the sentiments
of Briçonnet and Lefevre. Francis, who loved learning,
who invited into his states learned men inclined to
Lutheranism, and who thought (as Erasmus says) "in this
manner to adorn and illustrate his age in a more magnificent
manner than he could have done by trophies, pyramids, or
by the most pompous structures," was himself carried away
by his sister, by Briçonnet, and by the literary men of his
court and universities. He would often be present at the
discussions of the learned, listening with delight to their
conversation at table, and calling them "his children." He
prepared the way for the Word of God by founding Hebrew
and Greek professorships. And hence Theodore Beza, when
placing his portrait at the head of the reformers, says:
"Pious spectator! do not shudder at the sight of this adversary!
Ought he not to have a part in this honour, who
expelled barbarism from the world, and with firm hand substituted
in its stead three languages and sound learning, to
be as it were the portals to the new building that was
shortly to be erected?"<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MARGARET RECEIVES THE GOSPEL.</div>

<p>But there was at the court of Francis I. one soul in particular,
which seemed prepared to receive the evangelical
influence of the doctor of Etaples and the bishop of Meaux.
Margaret, yet hesitating and wavering, in the midst of the
depraved society that surrounded her, looked for support,
and found it in the Gospel. She turned towards this fresh
breath that was reanimating the world, and inhaled it with
delight as an emanation from heaven. From some of the
ladies of her court she learnt what the new doctors were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
teaching; they lent her their writings, their little books,
called in the language of the time, "tracts;" and spoke to
her of the "primitive Church, of the pure Word of God, of
worshipping in spirit and in truth, of christian liberty which
shakes off the yoke of superstition and traditions of men to
bind them closer to God alone."<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> Erelong this princess
conversed with Lefevre, Farel, and Roussel; their zeal,
their piety, their purity of morals,&mdash;all in them struck her
imagination; but it was the Bishop of Meaux in particular,
who had long enjoyed her friendship, that became her guide
in the path of faith.</p>

<p>Thus, in the midst of the brilliant court of Francis I. and
of the profligate household of Louisa of Savoy, was accomplished
one of those conversions of the heart which, although
not thoroughly evangelical, are not the fruit of a mere
æsthetical religion. Margaret subsequently recorded in her
poems the different movements of her soul at this important
period of her life; and in them we may trace the path she
then trod. We find that the sense of sin had taken strong
hold of her, and that she wept over the levity with which she
had treated the scandals of the world. She exclaimed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Is there a gulf of ill, so deep and wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That can suffice but e'en a tenth to hide<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Of my vile sins?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This corruption, of which she had so long been ignorant,
she discovered everywhere, now that her eyes were opened.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well do I feel within me is the root,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">ADORATION.</div>

<p>Yet amidst the alarm caused by the state of her soul, she
felt that a God of peace had appeared to her:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My God, thou hast come down on earth to me,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me, although a naked worm I be.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>
<p>And erelong a sense of the love of God in Christ was shed
abroad in her heart.</p>

<p>Margaret had found faith, and her enraptured soul indulged
in holy transports.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">From death by death our liberator.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By faith we're made the sons of the Creator.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From this time a great change took place in the Duchess
of Alençon:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though poor, and weak, and ignorant I be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How rich, how strong, how wise I am in Thee!<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the power of sin was not yet subdued in her. She
found a struggle, a discord in her soul that alarmed her:<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">God's dwelling place,&mdash;and yet how little worth.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Margaret, seeking in nature the symbols that might express
the wants and affections of her soul, chose for her
emblem (says Brantôme) the marigold, "which by its rays
and leaves, has more affinity with the sun, and turns wherever
he goes."<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>&mdash;She added this device:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Non inferiora secutus</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seek not things below,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"as a sign," adds the courtly writer, "that she directed all
her actions, thoughts, desires, and affections, to that great
sun which is God; and hence she was suspected of being
attached to the Lutheran religion."<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MARGARET'S CHARACTER AND INFLUENCE.</div>

<p>In fact, the princess experienced, not long after, the
truth of the saying, that <i>all who will live godly in Jesus
Christ shall suffer persecution</i>. At the court, they talked
of Margaret's new opinions, and the surprise was great.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
What! even the sister of the king takes part with these
people! For a moment it might have been thought that
Margaret's ruin was certain. She was denounced to Francis
I. But the king, who was tenderly attached to his sister,
pretended to think that it was untrue. Margaret's character
gradually lessened the opposition. Every one loved her,
says Brantôme: "she was very kind, mild, gracious, charitable,
affable, a great alms-giver, despising nobody, and
winning all hearts by her excellent qualities."<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of the corruption and frivolity of that age,
the mind reposes with delight on this chosen soul, which
the grace of God had seized beneath such a load of vanities
and grandeur. But her feminine character held her back.
If Francis I. had felt his sister's convictions, he would no
doubt have followed them out. The timid heart of the
princess trembled before the anger of the king. She was
constantly wavering between her brother and her Saviour,
and could not resolve to sacrifice either. We cannot recognise
her as a Christian who has reached the perfect
liberty of the children of God: she is a correct type of those
elevated souls, so numerous in every age, particularly among
women, who, powerfully attracted towards heaven, have
not sufficient strength to detach themselves entirely from the
earth.</p>

<p>However, such as she is, she is a pleasing character on
the stage of history. Neither Germany nor England present
her parallel. She is a star, slightly clouded no doubt, but
shedding an indescribable and gentle radiance, and at the
time of which I am treating her rays shone out still more
brightly. It is not until later years, when the angry looks of
Francis I. denounce a mortal hatred against the Reformation,
that his frightened sister will screen her holy faith
from the light of day. But now she raises her head in the
midst of this corrupted court, and appears a bride of Christ.
The respect paid to her, the high opinion entertained of her
understanding and of her heart, plead the cause of the
Gospel at the court of France much better than any
preacher could have done. The gentle influence of woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
gained admission for the new doctrine. It is perhaps to this
period we should trace the inclination of the French nobility
to embrace Protestantism. If Francis had followed his
sister, if all the nation had opened its gates to Christianity,
Margaret's conversion might have been the saving of France.
But while the nobles welcomed the Gospel, the king and the
people remained faithful to Rome; and there came a time
when it was a cause of serious misfortune to the Reformation
to count a Navarre and a Condé among its ranks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENEMIES OF THE REFORMATION.</div>

<p>Thus already had the Gospel made illustrious conquests in
France. Lefevre, Briçonnet, Farel, and Margaret joyfully
yielded in Paris to the movement that was already beginning
to shake the world. Francis I. himself seemed at that
time more attracted by the splendour of literature, than repelled
by the severity of the Gospel. The friends of the Word
of God were entertaining the most pleasing expectations; they
thought that the heavenly doctrine would be disseminated
without obstacle over their country, at the very moment when
a formidable opposition was organizing at court and in the
Sorbonne. France, which was to signalize itself among
Roman-catholic states for nearly three centuries by its persecutions,
rose with pitiless severity against the Reformation.
If the seventeenth century was the age of a bloody victory,
the sixteenth was that of a cruel struggle. Probably in no
place did the reformed Christians meet with more merciless
adversaries on the very spot where they raised the standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
of the Gospel. In Germany, it was in the Romish states
that their enemies were found; in Switzerland, in the Romish
cantons; but in France, it was face to face. A dissolute
woman and a rapacious minister then headed the long list
of the enemies of the Reformation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOUISA&mdash;DUPRAT&mdash;THE CONCORDAT.</div>

<p>Louisa of Savoy, mother of the king and of Margaret,
notorious for her gallantries, absolute in her will, and surrounded
by a train of ladies of honour whose licentiousness
began at the court of France a long series of immorality and
scandal, naturally took part against the Word of God; she
was the more to be feared as she had always preserved an
almost unbounded influence over her son. But the Gospel
met with a still more formidable adversary in Louisa's favourite,
Anthony Duprat, who was nominated chancellor of the
kingdom by her influence. This man, whom a contemporary
historian calls the most vicious of all bipeds,<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> was more rapacious
than Louisa was dissolute. Having first enriched
himself at the expense of justice, he desired subsequently to
increase his wealth at the expense of religion, and entered
holy orders to gain possession of the richest livings.</p>

<p>Lust and avarice thus characterized these two persons,
who, being both devoted to the pope, endeavoured to conceal
the disorders of their lives by the blood of the heretics.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a></p>

<p>One of their first acts was to deliver up the kingdom to
the ecclesiastical dominion of the pope. The king, after the
battle of Marignan, met Leo X. at Bologna, and there was
sealed the famous <i>concordat</i>, in virtue of which these two
princes divided the spoils of the Church between them.
They annulled the supremacy of councils to give it to the
pope; and depriving the churches of their right to fill up
the vacant bishoprics and livings, conferred it on the king.
After this, Francis I., supporting the pontiff's train, proceeded
to the minster-church of Bologna to ratify this negotiation.
He was sensible of the injustice of the concordat,
and turning to Duprat, whispered in his ear: "It is enough
to damn us both."<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> But what was salvation to him? Money
and the pope's alliance were what he wanted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESISTANCE OF THE PARLIAMENT AND UNIVERSITY.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>The parliament vigorously resisted the concordat. The king
made its deputies wait several weeks at Amboise, and then
calling them before him one day, as he rose from table, he
said: "There is a king in France, and I will not have a
Venetian senate formed in my dominions." He then commanded
them to depart before sunset. Evangelical liberty had
nothing to hope from such a prince. Three days after, the
high-chamberlain La Tremouille appeared in parliament, and
ordered the concordat to be registered.</p>

<p>Upon this the university put itself in motion. On the
18th of March 1518, a solemn procession, at which all the
students and the bachelors with their hoods were present,
repaired to the church of Saint Catherine of the Scholars,
to implore God to preserve the liberties of the Church and
of the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> "The colleges were closed, strong bodies
of the students went armed through the city, threatening
and sometimes maltreating the exalted personages who
were publishing and carrying out the said concordat by the
king's orders."<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> The university eventually tolerated the
execution of this edict; but without revoking the resolutions
on which it had declared its opposition; and from that
time, says the Venetian ambassador Correro, "the king
began to give away the bishoprics with a liberal hand at
the solicitation of the court ladies, and to bestow abbeys on
his soldiers; so that at the court of France a trade was
carried on in bishoprics and abbeys, as at Venice in pepper
and cinnamon."<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SORBONNE&mdash;BEDA.</div>

<p>While Louisa and Duprat were preparing to destroy the
Gospel by the destruction of the liberties of the Gallican
Church, a fanatical and powerful party was forming against
the Bible. Christian truth has always had to encounter
two powerful adversaries, the depravity of the world and
the fanaticism of the priests. The scholastic Sorbonne and
a profligate court were now to march forward hand in hand
against the confessors of Jesus Christ. In the early days
of the Church, the unbelieving Sadducees and the hypocritical
Pharisees were the fiercest enemies of Christianity; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
so they have remained through every age. Erelong from
the darkness of the schools emerged the most pitiless adversaries
of the Gospel. At their head was Noel Bédier,
commonly called Beda, a native of Picardy and syndic of
the Sorbonne, reputed to be the greatest brawler and most
factious spirit of his day. Educated in the dry maxims of
scholasticism, matured in the theses and antitheses of the
Sorbonne, having a greater veneration for the distinctions
of the school than for the Word of God, he was transported
with anger against those whose daring mouths
ventured to put forth other doctrines. Of a restless disposition,
unable to enjoy any repose, always requiring new
pursuits, he was a torment to all around him; confusion
was his native element; he seemed born for contention;
and when he had no adversaries he fell foul of his friends.
This impetuous quack filled the university with stupid and
violent declamations against literature, against the innovations
of the age, and against all those who were not, in his
opinion, sufficiently earnest in repressing them. Many
smiled as they listened to him, but others gave credit to the
invectives of the blustering orator, and the violence of his
character secured him a tyrannical sway in the Sorbonne.
He must always have some new enemy to fight, some
victim to drag to the scaffold; and accordingly he had
created heretics before any existed, and had called for the
burning of Merlin, vicar-general of Paris, for having endeavoured
to justify Origen. But when he saw the new
doctors appear, he bounded like a wild beast that suddenly
perceives an easy prey within its reach. "There are three
thousand monks in one Beda," said the cautious Erasmus.<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a></p>

<p>These excesses, however, were prejudicial to his cause.
"What!" said the wisest men of the age, "does the Roman
Church rest on the shoulders of such an Atlas as this?<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>
Whence comes all this disturbance, except from the absurdities
of Beda himself?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOUIS DE BERQUIN.</div>

<p>In effect, the very invectives that frightened weak minds,
disgusted more generous spirits. At the court of Francis I.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
was a gentleman of Artois, named Louis de Berquin, then
about thirty years of age, and who was never married.
The purity of his life,<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> his profound knowledge, which procured
him the title of "the most learned of the nobles,"<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>
the openness of his disposition, his tender care for the poor,
and his unbounded attachment to his friends, distinguished
him above his equals.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> There was not a more devout observer
of the ceremonies of the Church, fasts, festivals, and
masses;<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> and he held in the greatest horror all that was
denominated heretical. It was a matter of astonishment to
witness so much devotion at the court.</p>

<p>It seemed as if nothing could make such a man incline to
the side of the Reformation; there were, however, one or
two features in his character that might lead him to the
Gospel. He abhorred every kind of dissimulation, and, as
he never desired to injure any one himself, he could not bear
to see others injured. The tyranny of Beda and other
fanatics, their bickerings and persecutions, filled his generous
soul with indignation; and as he never did things by halves,
he was accustomed wherever he went, in the city or at the
court, "even among the highest personages in the kingdom,"<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>
to inveigh with the utmost vehemence against the
tyranny of these doctors, and attack, "in their very nests,"
says Theodore Beza, "those odious hornets who were then
the terror of the world."<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a></p>

<p>He did not stop here: opposition to injustice led Berquin
to inquire after truth. He desired to know that holy Scripture,
so dear to the men against whom Beda and his creatures
were raging; and he had scarcely begun to read the
book, before it won his heart. Berquin immediately joined
Margaret, Lefevre, Briçonnet, and all those who loved the
Word, and in their society tasted of the purest joys. He felt
that he had something more to do besides opposing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
Sorbonne, and would have loved to communicate the convictions
of his soul to all France. He immediately began
to write and translate several christian books into French.
It seemed to him that every man ought to acknowledge and
embrace the truth as promptly as he had done himself.
That impetuosity which Beda had exerted in the service of
human traditions, Berquin employed in the service of the
Word of God. Although younger than the syndic of the
Sorbonne, less prudent, and less skilful, he had in his favour
the noble enthusiasm of truth. They were two strong
wrestlers about to try which should throw the other. But
Berquin had another object in view than a triumph over
Beda: he would have desired to pour forth floods of truth
over all his countrymen. And hence Theodore Beza says,
that France might have found a second Luther in Berquin,
if he had found a second elector in Francis I.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RINGLEADERS OF THE SORBONNE.</div>

<p>Numerous obstacles were destined to impede his efforts.
Fanaticism finds disciples everywhere; it is a fire that
spreads far and near. The monks and ignorant priests took
part with the syndic of the Sorbonne. A party-spirit pervaded
the whole troop, which was governed by a few intriguing and
fanatical leaders, who cleverly took advantage of the insignificance
or vanity of their colleagues, to infect them with
their own prejudices. At all their meetings these chiefs
were the only speakers: they domineered over their party
by their violence, and reduced the moderate and weak-minded
to silence. Hardly had they made any proposition,
before these ringleaders exclaimed: "We shall soon see now
who are of the Lutheran faction."<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> Did any one give utterance
to a reasonable sentiment, a shuddering fell upon
Beda, Lecouturier, Duchesne, and the whole band; and all
cried out at once: "He is worse than Luther." This
man&oelig;uvre was successful; the timid minds that prefer
peace to disputation, those who are ready to give up their
own opinions for their own advantage, those who do not
understand the simplest questions, and, lastly, those who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
always carried away by the clamour of others,&mdash;all became
the willing recruits of Beda and his satellites. Some were
silent, others shouted, all submitted to that influence which
a proud and tyrannical mind exercises over vulgar souls.
Such was the state of this association, which was regarded
as so venerable, and which was at that time the most violent
enemy of evangelical Christianity. It would often be sufficient
to cast a single glance upon the most celebrated bodies
to estimate at its just value the war they wage upon truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SERVILITY OF THE GALLICAN CLERGY.</div>

<p>Thus the university which, under Louis XII., had applauded
Allmain's aspirations after independence, abruptly
plunged once more, under Duprat and Louisa of Savoy, into
fanaticism and servility. If we except the Jansenists and a
few other doctors, a noble and real independence has never
existed among the Gallican clergy. They have never done
more than oscillate between servility to the court and servility
to the pope. If under Louis XII. or Louis XIV. they had
some appearance of liberty, it was because their master in
Paris was at strife with their master at Rome. And thus
we have an explanation of the change we have pointed out.
The university and the bishops forgot their rights and duties
as soon as the king ceased to enjoin their observance.</p>

<p>For a long period Beda had been incensed against Lefevre;
the renown of the Picard doctor's lectures irritated
his compatriot and ruffled his pride; he would gladly have
silenced him. Once already Beda had attacked the doctor
of Etaples, and as yet little able to distinguish the evangelical
doctrines, he had assailed his colleague on a point which,
however strange it may appear, was near sending Lefevre to
the scaffold.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> This doctor had asserted that Mary, the
sister of Lazarus, Mary Magdalen, and the "woman which
was a sinner," of whom Saint Luke speaks in the seventh
chapter of his Gospel, were three distinct persons. The
Greek fathers had distinguished them: the Latin fathers
had confounded them together. This terrible <i>heresy</i> of the
three Magdalens set Beda and all his host in motion; Christendom
was roused; Fisher, bishop of Rochester, one of
the most distinguished prelates of the age, wrote against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Lefevre, and the whole Church then declared against an
opinion now admitted by every Roman-catholic. Already
Lefevre, condemned by the Sorbonne, was prosecuted by the
parliament as a heretic, when Francis I., pleased at the
opportunity of striking a blow at the Sorbonne and of
humbling the monks, rescued him from the hands of his
persecutors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER CONDEMNED AT PARIS.</div>

<p>Beda, enraged at seeing his victim snatched from his
grasp, resolved to take better aim another time. The name
of Luther was beginning to be heard in France. The reformer,
after the dispute with Dr. Eck at Leipsic, had agreed
to acknowledge the universities of Erfurth and Paris as his
judges. The zeal displayed by the latter university against
the concordat, no doubt led him to hope that he should find
impartial judges in its members. But the times were
changed, and the more decided the theological faculty had
been against the encroachments of Rome, the more it was
bent on showing its orthodoxy. Beda accordingly found it
quite disposed to enter into his views.</p>

<p>On the 20th of January 1520, the treasurer of the French
nation<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> bought twenty copies of the conference between
Luther and Eck for distribution among the members of
the commission who were to make a report on the matter.
More than a year was employed in this investigation. The
German Reformation was beginning to create a strong sensation
in France. The universities, which were then truly
catholic institutions, to which students resorted from every
country in Christendom, brought Germany, France, Switzerland,
and England, into closer and speedier relation with each
other, as regards theology and philosophy, than those of the
present day. The reports prevailing in Paris of Luther's success
strengthened the hands of such men as Lefevre, Briçonnet,
and Farel. Each of his victories increased their courage.
Many of the Sorbonne doctors were struck by the admirable
truths they found in the writings of the Wittemberg monk.
There had already been many a bold confession; but there
had also been a terrible resistance. "All Europe," says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
Crévier, "was waiting for the decision of the university of
Paris." The contest appeared doubtful. At length Beda
prevailed; and in April 1521, the university decreed that
Luther's works should be publicly burnt, and the author
compelled to retract.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SORBONNE ADDRESSES THE KING.</div>

<p>This was not enough. In fact Luther's disciples had
crossed the Rhine more speedily even than his writings.
"In a short time," says the Jesuit Maimbourg, "the university
was filled with foreigners, who, because they knew
a little Hebrew and more Greek, acquired a reputation, insinuated
themselves into the houses of persons of quality,
and claimed an insolent liberty of interpreting the Bible."<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a>
The faculty, therefore, appointed a deputation to bear their
remonstrances to the king.</p>

<p>Francis I., caring little for the quarrels of theologians, was
continuing his career of pleasure; and passing from castle
to castle, with his gentlemen and the ladies composing his
mother's and his sister's court, he indulged in every species
of disorder, far from the troublesome observation of the
citizens of the capital. He thus made his progresses through
Brittany, Anjou, Guienne, Angoumois, and Poitou, leading
the same sumptuous life in villages and forests, as if he had
been at Paris in his palace of Tournelles. It was one round
of tournaments, sham-fights, masquerades, costly entertainments,
and banquets, which even those of Lucullus (as
Brantôme says) could not equal.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></p>

<p>For a moment, however, he interrupted the course of his
pleasures to receive the grave deputies of the Sorbonne; but
he saw only men of learning in those whom the faculty
pointed out as heretics. Could a prince who boasted of
having put the kings of France <i>hors de page</i> (out of leading-strings),
bend his head before a few fanatical doctors? He
replied: "I will not have these people molested. To persecute
those who teach us, would prevent able scholars from
coming into our country."<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a></p>

<p>The deputation left the king's presence in great wrath.
What will be the consequence? The disease grows stronger
every day; already the heretical opinions are denominated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
"the sentiments of men of genius;" the devouring flame is
stealing into the most secret recesses; erelong the conflagration
will burst forth, and throughout France the edifice of
faith will fall with a terrible crash.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEFEVRE RETIRES TO MEAUX.</div>

<p>Beda and his party, failing to obtain the king's permission
to erect their scaffolds, resort to persecutions of a more invidious
nature. There was no kind of annoyance to which the
evangelical teachers were not subjected. Fresh reports and
fresh denunciations followed each other daily. The aged
Lefevre, tormented by these ignorant zealots, longed for repose.
The pious Briçonnet, who was unremitting in his
veneration for the doctor of Etaples,<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> offered him an asylum.
Lefevre quitted Paris and retired to Meaux. This was the
first victory gained over the Gospel, and it was then seen
that if the Romish party cannot succeed in engaging the civil
power on its side, there is a secret and fanatical police, by
means of which it is enabled to obtain its end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Briçonnet visits his Diocese&mdash;Reform&mdash;The Doctors persecuted in Paris&mdash;Philiberta
of Savoy&mdash;Correspondence between Margaret and Briçonnet.</p></blockquote>


<p>Thus Paris was beginning to rise against the Reformation,
and to trace the outlines of that circumvallation which was
destined for more than three centuries to bar the entrance
of the reformed worship. It had been God's will that the
first beams of light should shine upon the capital; but men
immediately arose to extinguish them; the spirit of the
<i>Sixteen</i><a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> was already fermenting in the metropolis, and other
cities were about to receive the light which Paris rejected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRIÇONNET REFORMS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>Briçonnet, on returning to his diocese, had manifested the
zeal of a Christian and of a bishop. He had visited every
parish, and, assembling the deans, the incumbents, and their
curates, with the church-wardens and principal parishioners,
had inquired into the doctrine and lives of the preachers. At
collection time (they answered) the Franciscans of Meaux
begin their rounds; a single preacher will visit four or five
parishes in a day, always delivering the same sermon, not to
feed the souls of his hearers, but to fill his belly, his purse,
and his convent.<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> Their wallets once replenished, their end
is gained, the sermons are over, and the monks do not appear
again in the churches until the time for another collection
has arrived. The only business of these shepherds is
to shear their sheep.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a></p>

<p>The majority of the parish priests spent their stipends at
Paris. "Alas!" exclaimed the pious bishop, finding a presbytery
deserted that he had gone to visit, "are they not traitors
who thus desert the service of Jesus Christ?"<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> Briçonnet
resolved to apply a remedy to these evils, and convoked
a synod of all his clergy for the 13th of October 1519.
But these worldly priests, who troubled themselves but little
about the remonstrances of their bishop, and for whom Paris
had so many charms, took advantage of a custom in virtue
of which they might substitute one or more curates to tend
their flocks in their absence. Out of one hundred and twenty-seven
of these curates, there were only fourteen of whom
Briçonnet could approve upon examination.</p>

<p>Worldly-minded priests, imbecile curates, monks who
thought only of their belly;&mdash;such was then the condition of
the Church. Briçonnet interdicted the Franciscans from entering
the pulpit;<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> published a mandate on the 27th of October
1520, in which he declared "traitors and deserters all
those pastors who, by abandoning their flocks, show plainly
that what they love is their fleece and their wool; selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
others who were found to be capable, and gave them to the
poor sheep, ransomed by the most holy blood of Jesus
Christ;"<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> and feeling convinced that the only means of providing
able ministers for his diocese was to train them himself,
he determined to establish a theological school at Meaux,
under the direction of pious and learned doctors. It was
necessary to find them, and Beda soon provided them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PERSECUTIONS IN PARIS.</div>

<p>This fanatic and his band did not relax their exertions;
and, bitterly complaining of the toleration of their government,
declared that they would make war on the new doctrines
with it, without it, and against it. In vain had Lefevre
quitted the capital; did not Farel and his friends remain
behind? Farel, it is true, did not preach, for he was not in
holy orders; but at the university and in the city, with professors
and priests, students and citizens, he boldly maintained
the cause of the Reformation. Others, inspirited by
his example, were inculcating the Gospel more openly. A
celebrated preacher, Martial Mazurier, president of St.
Michael's college, threw aside all reserve, depicted the disorders
of the age in the darkest and yet truest colours,
and it seemed impossible to resist the torrent of his eloquence.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a>
The anger of Beda and his theological friends was
at its height. "If we tolerate these innovators," said he,
"they will invade the whole body, and all will be over with
our teaching, our traditions, our places, and the respect felt
towards us by France and the whole of Christendom!"</p>

<p>The divines of the Sorbonne were the stronger party.
Farel, Mazurier, Gerard Roussel, and his brother Arnold,
soon found their active exertions everywhere thwarted. The
Bishop of Meaux entreated his friends to come and join Lefevre;
and these excellent men, hunted down by the Sorbonne,
and hoping to form, under Briçonnet's protection, a
sacred phalanx for the triumph of the truth, accepted the
bishop's invitation, and repaired to Meaux.<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> Thus the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
of the Gospel was gradually withdrawn from the capital,
where Providence had kindled its earliest sparks. <i>And this
is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men
loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</i><a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a>
It is impossible not to discover that Paris then drew down
upon its walls the judgment of God pointed out in these
words of Jesus Christ.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PHILIBERTA OF SAVOY.</div>

<p>Margaret of Valois, successively deprived of Briçonnet,
Lefevre, and their friends, felt anxious at her lonely position
in the midst of Paris and the licentious court of Francis I.
A young princess, Philiberta of Savoy, her mother's sister,
lived in close intimacy with her. Philiberta, whom the King
of France had given in marriage to Julian the Magnificent,
brother to Leo X., in confirmation of the concordat, had repaired
to Rome after her nuptials, when the pope, delighted
at so illustrious an alliance, had expended 150,000 ducats in
sumptuous festivities on the occasion.<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> Julian, who then
commanded the papal army, died, leaving his widow only
eighteen years of age. She became attached to Margaret,
who by her talents and virtues exercised a great influence
over all around her. Philiberta's grief opened her
heart to the voice of religion. Margaret imparted to her
all she read; and the widow of the lieutenant-general of the
Church began to taste the sweets of the doctrine of salvation.
But Philiberta was too inexperienced to support her
friend. Margaret often trembled as she thought of her exceeding
weakness. If the love she bore the king and the
fear she had of displeasing him led her to any action contrary
to her conscience, trouble immediately entered into her
soul, and turning sorrowfully towards the Lord, she found in
him a brother and a master more compassionate and dearer
to her heart than Francis himself. It was then she said to
Jesus Christ:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MARGARET TO BRIÇONNET&mdash;REPLY.</div>

<p>Margaret seeing all her friends retiring to Meaux, looked
sadly after them from the midst of the festivities of the
court. Everything appeared to be deserting her again. Her
husband, the Duke of Alençon, was setting out for the
army; her youthful aunt Philiberta was going to Savoy.
The duchess turned to Briçonnet.</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Meaux," wrote she, "knowing that One
alone is necessary, I apply to you, entreating you to be, by
prayer, the means that He will be pleased to guide according
to His holy will, M. d'Alençon, who by command of
the king is setting out as lieutenant-general in his army,
which I fear will not be disbanded without a war. And
thinking that, besides the public weal of the kingdom, you
have a good title in whatsoever concerns his salvation and
mine, I pray for your spiritual aid. To-morrow, my aunt of
Nemours departs for Savoy. I am obliged to meddle with
many things that cause me much fear. Wherefore, if you
should know that master Michael could undertake a journey
hither, it would be a consolation to me, which I beseech only
for the honour of God."<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a></p>

<p>Michael of Aranda, whose aid Margaret sought, was a
member of the evangelical society of Meaux, and who subsequently
exposed himself to many dangers in preaching the
Gospel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRIÇONNET TO MARGARET&mdash;PHILIBERTA.</div>

<p>This pious princess beheld with alarm the opposition against
truth becoming more formidable every day. Duprat and the
creatures of the government, Beda and those of the Sorbonne,
filled her with terror. Briçonnet, to encourage her, replied:
"It is the war which the gentle Jesus told us in the Gospel
he came to send on earth......and also the fire......the great
fire that transformeth earthliness into heavenliness. I desire
with all my heart to aid you, madam, but from my own
nothingness expect nothing but the will. Whoso hath faith,
hope, and love, hath all he requires, and needeth not aid or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
support......God alone is all in all, and out of him can
nothing be found. To fight, take with you that great
giant......love unspeakable......The war is led on by love.
Jesus demandeth the presence of the heart: wretched is
the man who withdraws from him. Whoso fighteth in
person is sure of victory. He often faileth who fighteth by
others."<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>

<p>The Bishop of Meaux was beginning to know by personal
experience what it is to fight for the Word of God. The
theologians and monks, irritated by the asylum he gave to
the friends of the Reformation, accused him with such violence
that his brother, the Bishop of St. Malo, came to Paris
to inquire into the matter.<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> Hence Margaret was the more
touched by the consolations that Briçonnet addressed to her,
and she replied with offers of assistance.</p>

<p>"If in anything," she wrote, "you think that I can
pleasure you or yours, I pray you believe that every trouble
will turn to my comfort. May everlasting peace be yours
after these long wars you are waging for the faith, in which
battle you desire to die......</p>

</p>

<p>It is to be lamented that Briçonnet did not die in the contest.
Yet he was then full of zeal. Philiberta of Nemours,
respected by all for her sincere devotion, her liberality towards
the poor, and the great purity of her life, read with increasing
interest the evangelical writings transmitted to her
by the Bishop of Meaux. "I have all the tracts that you
have sent me," wrote Margaret to Briçonnet, "of which my
aunt of Nemours has her part, and I will forward her the last;
for she is in Savoy at her brother's wedding, which is no slight
loss to me; wherefore I beseech you have pity on my loneliness."
Unhappily Philiberta did not live long enough to
declare herself openly in favour of the Reformation. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
died in 1524 at the castle of Virieu le Grand, in Bugey, at
the age of twenty-six.<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> This was a severe blow to Margaret.
Her friend, her sister, she who could fully comprehend her,
was taken from her. There was perhaps only one individual,
her brother, whose death would have occasioned her more
sorrow than this:</p>

seductions of the court, entreated Briçonnet to exhort her to
the love of God, and the humble bishop replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"May the mild and gentle Jesus, who wills, and who alone
is able to effect what he mightily wills, in his infinite mercy
visit your heart, exhorting you to love him with your whole
being. Other than he, madam, none has the power to do
this; you must not seek light from darkness, or warmth
from cold. By attracting he kindles; and by warmth he
attracts to follow him, enlarging the heart. Madam, you
write to me to have pity on you, because you are alone. I
do not understand that word. Whoso lives in the world and
has his heart there, is alone; for many and evil go together.
But she whose heart sleeps to the world, and is awake to
the meek and gentle Jesus, her true and loyal husband, is
truly alone, for she lives on the one thing needful; and yet
she is not alone, not being forsaken by him who fills and
preserves all things. Pity I cannot, and must not, such
loneliness, which is more to be esteemed than the whole
world, from which I am persuaded that the love of God has
saved you, and that you are no longer its child......Abide,
madam, alone in your only One......who has been pleased to
suffer a painful and ignominious death and passion.</p>

<p>"Madam, in commending myself to your good graces, I
entreat you not to use any more such words as in your last
letters. Of God alone you are the daughter and bride: other
father you should not seek......I exhort and admonish you,
that you will be such and as good a daughter to him, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
is a good Father to you......and forasmuch as you cannot
attain to this, because the finite cannot correspond to infinity,
I pray that he will vouchsafe to increase your strength, that
you may love and serve him with your whole heart."<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE STRAY SHEEP&mdash;THE FOREST.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding these exhortations, Margaret was not
consoled. She bitterly regretted the spiritual guides whom
she had lost; the new pastors forced upon her to bring her
back did not possess her confidence, and whatever the bishop
might say, she felt herself alone in the midst of the court,
and all around her appeared dark and desolate. "As a sheep
in a strange country," wrote she to Briçonnet, "wandering
about, not knowing where to find its pasture, through lack
of knowing its new shepherds, naturally lifts its head to catch
the breeze from that quarter where the chief shepherd was
once accustomed to give her sweet nourishment, in such sort
am I constrained to pray for your charity......Come down
from the high mountain, and in pity regard, among this
benighted people, the blindest of all thy fold.</p>

<p class="signature">"<span class="smcap">Margaret.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a></p>

<p>The Bishop of Meaux, in his reply, taking up the image of
the stray sheep under which Margaret had depicted herself,
uses it to describe the mysteries of salvation under the figure
of a wood: "The sheep entering the forest, led by the Holy
Ghost," said he, "is immediately enchanted by the goodness,
beauty, straightness, length, breadth, depth, and height,
and the fragrant and invigorating sweetness of this forest......and
when it has looked all around, has seen only Him in all,
and all in Him;<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> and moving rapidly through its depths,
finds it so pleasant, that the way is life, and joy, and consolation."<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a>
The bishop then shows her the sheep searching
in vain for the limits of the forest (an image of the soul that
would fathom the mysteries of God), meeting with lofty
mountains, which it endeavours to scale, finding everywhere
"inaccessible and incomprehensible infinity." He then teaches
her the road by which the soul, inquiring after God, surmounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
all these difficulties; he shows how the sheep in the
midst of the hirelings finds "the cabin of the great Shepherd,"
and "enters on the wing of meditation by faith;" all
is made smooth, all is explained; and she begins to sing:
"I have found him whom my soul loveth."</p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRE AND ICE.</div>

<p>Thus wrote the Bishop of Meaux. At that period he was
burning with zeal, and would gladly have seen all France
regenerated by the Gospel.<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> Often would his mind dwell
especially on those three great individuals who seemed to
preside over the destinies of its people,&mdash;the king, his mother,
and his sister. He thought that if the royal family were
enlightened, all the people would be so, and the priests,
stirred to rivalry, would at last awaken from their lethargy.
"Madam," wrote he to Margaret, "I humbly entreat Almighty
God, that he will be pleased of his goodness to kindle
a fire in the hearts of the king, of his mother, and in your
own......so that from you there may go forth a light burning
and shining on the rest of the nation; and particularly that
class by whose coldness all others are frozen."</p>

<p>Margaret did not share these hopes. She speaks neither
of her brother nor of her mother; they were subjects she
dared not touch upon; but, replying to the bishop in January
1522, with a heart wrung by the indifference and worldliness
of those around her, she said: "The times are so cold,
my heart so icy;" and signs her letter, "your frozen, thirsty,
and hungry daughter,</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Margaret</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>This letter did not discourage Briçonnet, but it made him
ponder; and feeling how much he, who desired to re-animate
others, required to be animated himself, he commended
himself to the prayers of Margaret and of Madam de Nemours.
"Madam," wrote he, with great simplicity, "I beseech
you to awaken the poor slumberer with your prayers."<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p>

<p>Such in 1521 were the sentiments interchanged at the
court of France. A strange correspondence, no doubt, and
which, after more than three centuries, a manuscript in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
Royal Library has revealed to us. Was this influence of
the Reformation in such high places a benefit to it or a misfortune?
The sting of truth penetrated the court; but perhaps
it only served to arouse the drowsy beast, and exciting
his rage, caused it to spring with deadlier fury on the humblest
of the flock.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Beginning of the Church at Meaux&mdash;The Scriptures in French&mdash;The
Artisans and the Bishop&mdash;Evangelical Harvest&mdash;The Epistles of St.
Paul sent to the King&mdash;Lefevre and Roma&mdash;The Monks before the

<div class="sidenote">BEGINNING OF THE CHURCH AT MEAUX.</div>

<p>The time was indeed approaching when the storm should
burst upon the Reformation; but it was first to scatter a
few more seeds and to gather in a few more sheaves. This
city of Meaux, renowned a century and a half later by the
sublime defender<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> of the Gallican system against the autocratic
pretensions of Rome, was called to be the first town
of France where regenerated Christianity should establish
its dominion. It was then the field on which the labourers
were prodigal of their exertions and their seed, and where
already the ears were falling before the reapers. Briçonnet,
less sunk in slumber than he had said, was animating, inspecting,
and directing all. His fortune equalled his zeal;
never did man devote his wealth to nobler uses, and never
did such noble devotedness promise at first to bear such
glorious fruits. The most pious teachers, transferred from
Paris to Meaux, from that time acted with more liberty.
There was freedom of speech, and great was the stride then
taken by the Reformation in France. Lefevre energetically
expounded that Gospel with which he would have rejoiced to
fill the world. He exclaimed: "Kings, princes, nobles, people,
all nations should think and aspire after Christ alone.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
priest should resemble that archangel whom John saw in
the Apocalypse, flying through the air, holding the everlasting
Gospel in his hand, and carrying it to every people,
nation, tongue, and king. Come near ye pontiffs, come ye
kings, come ye generous hearts!......Nations, awake to the
light of the Gospel, and inhale the heavenly life.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> The
Word of God is all-sufficient."<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WORD OF GOD ALL-SUFFICIENT.</div>

<p>Such in truth was the motto of that school: <span class="smcap">The Word
of God is all-sufficient</span>. In this device the whole Reformation
is embodied. "To know Christ and his Word,"
said Lefevre, Roussel, and Farel, "is the only living and
universal theology......He who knows that, knows everything."<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a></p>

<p>The truth was making a deep impression at Meaux.
Private meetings took place at first; then conferences; and
at last the Gospel was preached in the churches. But
a new effort inflicted a still more formidable blow against
Rome.</p>

<p>Lefevre desired to enable the Christians of France to read
the Holy Scriptures. On the 30th October 1522, he published
a French translation of the four Gospels; on the 6th
November, the remaining books of the New Testament; on
the 12th October 1524, all these books together, at the house
of Collin in Meaux; and in 1525, a French version of the
Psalms.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> Thus was begun in France, almost at the same
time as in Germany, that printing and dissemination of the
Scriptures in the vulgar tongue which, three centuries later,
was to be so wonderfully developed throughout the world.
In France, as on the other side of the Rhine, the Bible had
a decisive influence. Experience had taught many Frenchmen,
that when they sought to know Divine things, doubt
and obscurity encompassed them on every side. In how
many moments and perhaps years in their lives had they
been tempted to regard the most certain truths as mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
delusions! We need a ray from heaven to enlighten our
darkness. Such was the ejaculation of many a soul at the
epoch of the Reformation. With longings such as these, numbers
received the sacred writings from the hands of Lefevre;
they were read in their families and in private; conversations
on the Bible became frequent; Christ appeared to
those souls so long misled, as the centre and the sun of all
revelation. No longer did they require demonstrations to
prove that Scripture was from God; they knew it, for by it
they had been transported from darkness to light.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ARTISANS AND THE BISHOP.</div>

<p>Such was the course by which so many distinguished
persons in France attained a knowledge of God. But there
were yet simpler and more common paths, if such can be,
by which many of the lower classes were brought to the
truth. The city of Meaux was almost wholly inhabited
by artisans and dealers in wool. "There was engendered
in many," says a chronicler of the sixteenth century, "so
ardent a desire of knowing the way of salvation, that
artisans, fullers, and wool-combers took no other recreation,
as they worked with their hands, than to talk with each
other of the Word of God, and to comfort themselves with the
same. Sundays and holidays especially were devoted to the
reading of Scripture, and inquiring into the good pleasure of
the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a></p>

<p>Briçonnet rejoiced to see piety take the place of superstition
in his diocese. "Lefevre, aided by the renown of
his great learning," says a contemporary historian, "contrived
so to cajole and circumvent Messire Guillaume Briçonnet
with his plausible talk, that he caused him to turn
aside grievously, so that it has been impossible up to this
day to free the city and diocese of Meaux from that pestilent
doctrine, where it has so marvellously increased. The
misleading that good bishop was a great injury, as until
then he had been so devoted to God and to the Virgin
Mary."<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">EVANGELICAL HARVEST.</div>

<p>Yet all were not so grievously turned aside, as the Franciscan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
says, whom we have just quoted. The city was
divided into two parties. On the one side were the monks
of St. Francis and the friends of the Romish doctrine; on
the other, Briçonnet, Lefevre, Farel, and all those who loved
the new preaching. A man of the poorer classes, by name
Leclerc, was one of the most servile adherents of the monks;
but his wife and two sons, Peter and John, had received the
Gospel with eagerness, and John, who was a wool-carder,
soon distinguished himself among the new Christians.
James Pavanne, a learned and youthful Picard, "a man of
great sincerity and uprightness," whom Briçonnet had invited
to Meaux, showed an ardent zeal for the Reformation.
Meaux had become a focus of light. Persons called thither
by business heard the Gospel, and carried it back to their
homes. It was not in the city alone that men were examining
the Scriptures; "many of the villages did the same,"
says a chronicle, "so that in this diocese an image of the
renovated Church was seen to shine forth."</p>

<p>The environs of Meaux were covered with rich crops,
and at harvest season a crowd of labourers flocked thither
from the surrounding countries. Resting from their toils in
the middle of the day, they conversed with the people of the
place, who spoke to them of other seed-times and other harvests.
Many peasants from Thierache, and particularly
from Landouzy, persevered, on their return home, in the
doctrines they had heard, and erelong an evangelical church
was formed in this district, which is one of the oldest
churches in the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> "The renown of this great
blessing spread through France," says the chronicler.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> Briçonnet
himself proclaimed the Gospel from the pulpit, and
endeavoured to scatter around him "that infinite, sweet,
mild, true, and only light (to use his own words) which
dazzles and enlightens every creature capable of receiving
it, and which, while it enlightens him, raises him by adoption
to the dignity of a son of God."<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> He besought his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
flock to lend no ear to those who would turn them aside
from the Word. "Though an angel from heaven," said he,
"should preach any other Gospel, do not listen to him."
Sometimes gloomy thoughts would prey upon his soul. He
was not sure of himself: he shrunk back in alarm, as he
dwelt upon the fatal consequences of his unfaithfulness;
and forewarning his hearers, he said to them: "Even
should I, your bishop, change my language and my doctrine,
beware of changing like me."<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> At that moment nothing
seemed to indicate the possibility of such a misfortune.
"Not only was the Word of God preached," says the chronicle,
"but it was followed; all works of charity and love
were practised there; the morals were reformed and superstitions
laid low."<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BRIÇONNET'S FOREBODINGS&mdash;PRESENT TO THE KING.</div>

<p>Still clinging to the idea of gaining over the king and
his mother, the bishop sent to Margaret "the epistles of
St. Paul, translated and splendidly illuminated, most humbly
entreating her to present them to the king; which cannot
but be most pleasing from your hands," added the good
bishop. "They are a royal dish," continued he, "fattening
without corruption, and healing all manner of sickness.
The more we taste them, the more we hunger after them
with desire unsatiable, and that never cloys."<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

<p>What more welcome message could Margaret receive?
The moment seemed favourable. Michael Aranda was at
Paris, detained by order of the king's mother, for whom he
was translating portions of the Holy Scripture.<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> But
Margaret would have preferred that Briçonnet should present
this book himself to her brother. "You would do well
to come here," wrote she, "for you know the confidence that
Madam and the king place in you."<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a></p>

<p>Thus, probably, was the Word of God placed at that
time (in 1522 and 1523) under the eyes of Francis I. and
Louisa of Savoy. They came into contact with that Gospel
which they were afterwards to persecute. We do not find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
that this Word produced any salutary effect upon them. An
impulse of curiosity led them to open that Bible which was
then making so much noise; but they closed it as soon as
they had opened it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARGARET'S STRUGGLES.</div>

<p>Margaret herself found it hard to contend against the
worldliness by which she was everywhere surrounded.
Her tender affection towards her brother, the obedience she
owed to her mother, and the flatteries lavished on her by
the court, all seemed to conspire against the love she had
vowed to Christ. Christ was alone against many. Sometimes
Margaret's soul, assailed by so many adversaries, and
stunned by the noise of the world, turned aside from its
Master. Then, becoming sensible of her faults, the princess
would shut herself up in her apartments, and giving way
to her sorrow, utter cries very different from the joyous sounds
with which Francis and the young lords, the companions of
his debauchery, filled the royal palaces in the midst of their
entertainments and festivities:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Left you I have, to follow pleasure's voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left you I have, and for an evil choice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left you I have, and whither am I come?......<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then turning towards Meaux, Margaret would exclaim
in her anguish: "I return to you, to M. Fabry (Lefevre)
and all your gentlemen, beseeching you, by your prayers, to
obtain of the unspeakable Mercy an alarum for the poor
weak and sleepy one, to arouse her from her heavy and deadly
slumber."<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>

<p>Thus had Meaux become a focus whence the light of the
Gospel emanated. The friends of the Reformation indulged
in flattering illusions. Who could resist the Gospel if the
power of Francis cleared the way? The corrupting influence
of the court would then be changed into a holy influence,
and France would acquire a moral strength that
would render her the benefactress of the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROMA&mdash;THE MONKS AND THE BISHOP.</div>

<p>But, on their side, the friends of Rome had taken the
alarm. Among those at Meaux was a Jacobin monk
named Roma. One day, as Lefevre, Farel, and their friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
were talking with him and some other of the papal partisans,
Lefevre could not suppress his anticipations. "The
Gospel is already gaining the hearts of the great and of the
people," said he, "and in a short time, spreading all over
France, it will everywhere throw down the inventions of
men." The aged doctor was animated; his eyes sparkled;
his worn-out voice grew sonorous; one might have compared
him to the aged Simeon returning thanks to the Lord,
because his eyes had seen His salvation. Lefevre's friends
shared in his emotion: their amazed opponents were dumb.
On a sudden Roma started up impetuously, and exclaimed
in the tone of a popular tribune: "Then I and all the other
religioners will preach a crusade; we will raise the people;
and if the king permits the preaching of your Gospel, we
will expel him from his kingdom by his own subjects."<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a></p>

<p>Thus did a monk venture to rise up against the knightly
monarch. The Franciscans applauded this language. They
must not allow the doctor's prophecy to be fulfilled. Already
the friars were returning daily with diminished offerings.
The Franciscans in alarm went about among private
families. "These new teachers are heretics," said they;
"they attack the holiest observances, and deny the most
sacred mysteries." Then growing bolder, the most incensed
among them issued from their cloister, and proceeded to the
bishop's residence. On being admitted, they said to the prelate:
"Crush this heresy, or else the pestilence, which is
already desolating the city of Meaux, will spread over the
whole kingdom."</p>

<p>Briçonnet was moved, and for an instant disturbed by
this attack, but he did not give way; he felt too much contempt
for these ignorant monks and their interested clamours.
He went into the pulpit, justified Lefevre, and called
the monks pharisees and hypocrites. Still this opposition
had already excited trouble and conflict in his soul; he
sought to encourage himself by the persuasion that such
spiritual combats were necessary. "By this warfare," said
he, in his somewhat mystical language, "we arrive at a
vivifying death, and by continually mortifying life, we die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
living, and live dying."<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> The way would have been surer
if, casting himself upon the Saviour, as the apostles when
tossed by the winds and waves, he had exclaimed; "Lord,
help me! or I perish."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MONKS AND THE PARLIAMENT.</div>

<p>The monks of Meaux, enraged at their unfavourable reception
by the bishop, resolved to carry their complaints before
a higher tribunal. An appeal lay open to them. If
the bishop will not give way, he may be reduced to compliance.
Their leaders set out for Paris, and concerted
measures with Beda and Duchesne. They hastened before
the parliament, and denounced the bishop and the heretical
teachers. "The city and all the neighbourhood," said they,
"are infected with heresy, and its polluted waters flow from
the episcopal palace."</p>

<p>Thus did France begin to hear the cry of persecution
raised against the Gospel. The sacerdotal and the civil
power, the Sorbonne and the parliament, grasped their arms,&mdash;arms
that were to be stained with blood. Christianity
had taught mankind that there are duties and rights anterior
to all civil associations; it had emancipated the religious
mind, promoted liberty of conscience, and worked a
great change in society; for antiquity, which contemplated
the citizen everywhere and the man nowhere, had made
religion a mere matter of state. But these ideas of liberty
had scarcely been given to the world, ere the papacy corrupted
them; for the despotism of the prince it had substituted
the despotism of the priest; and not unfrequently
it had raised both prince and priest against the christian
people. A new emancipation was needed; it took place in
the sixteenth century. Wherever the Reformation established
itself, it broke the yoke of Rome, and the religious
mind was again enfranchised. But so rooted in the nature
of man is the disposition to tyrannize over truth, that among
many protestant nations, the Church, liberated from the
arbitrary power of the priest, has again in our days fallen
under the yoke of the civil power; destined, like its founder,
to be bandied from one despotism to another, to pass from
Caiaphas to Pilate, and from Pilate to Caiaphas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRIÇONNET'S FALL.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>Briçonnet had not the courage necessary for resistance.
He would not yield everything, but what he did concede
satisfied Rome. "We may well do without Luther's writings,"
he thought, "if we keep the Gospel; we may easily
accede to a certain invocation of the Virgin, if we add that
it is only by the mediation of Jesus Christ that she possesses
any influence." If beside the truth we place the power of
error, the papacy is satisfied. But the sacrifice which Briçonnet
felt the deepest, and which yet was required of him,
was the loss of his friends. If the bishop would escape, he
must sacrifice his brethren. Of timid character, but
little prepared to give up his riches and his station for
Christ's sake, already alarmed, shaken, and cast down, he
was still further led astray by treacherous advisers: if the
evangelical doctors should quit Meaux (said some), they will
carry the Reformation elsewhere. His heart was torn by a
painful struggle. At last the wisdom of this world prevailed;
he gave way, and, on the 15th of October 1523,
published three mandates, the first of which enjoined prayers
for the dead, and the invocation of the Virgin and of the
saints; the second forbade any one to buy, borrow, read,
possess, or carry about with him Luther's works, and ordered
them to be torn in pieces, to be scattered to the winds, or to
be burnt; and the last established in express terms the
doctrine of purgatory. Then, on the 13th of November in
the same year, Briçonnet forbade the parish priests and their
curates to permit the "Lutherans" to preach.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> This was
not all. The first president of the Parliament of Paris, and
Andrew Verjus, councillor in the same court, and before
whom Briçonnet had shortly afterwards to appear, arrived at
Meaux during Lent 1524, no doubt to satisfy themselves of
the bishop's proceedings. The poor prelate did all he could
to please them. Already on the 29th of January he had
taken the images of the saints under his especial protection;
he now began to visit his churches, to preach, and to struggle
hard in the presence of the first president and of councillor Verjus
to "weed out the heresies that were there shooting up."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a>
The deputies of the Parliament returned to Paris fully satisfied.
This was Briçonnet's first fall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEFEVRE AND FAREL&mdash;PERSECUTION.</div>

<p>Lefevre was the special object of hostility. His commentary
on the four Gospels, and particularly the "Epistle to
Christian Readers," prefixed to it, had inflamed the anger of
Beda and his allies. They denounced this writing to the
faculty. "Does he not dare to recommend all the faithful to
read the Scriptures?" said the fiery syndic. "Does he not
tell therein that whoever loves not Christ's Word is not a
Christian;<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> and that the Word of God is sufficient to lead
to eternal life?"</p>

<p>But Francis I. looked on this accusation as a mere theological
squabble. He appointed a commission; and Lefevre,
having justified himself before it, came off from this attack
with all the honours of war.</p>

<p>Farel, who had not so many protectors at court, was compelled
to leave Meaux. It would appear that he first repaired
to Paris;<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> and that, having unsparingly attacked the
errors of Rome, he could remain there no longer, and was
forced to retire to Dauphiny, whither he was eager to carry
the Gospel.</p>

<p>At the time of the dispersion of the Christians at Meaux,
another Frenchman, quitting his native country, crossed the
threshold of the Augustine convent at Wittemberg, where
Luther resided. This was in January 1523.</p>

<p>Farel was not the only man in the south of France whom
God had prepared for his work. A little further to the
south than Gap, on the banks of the Rhone, in that city of
Avignon called by Petrarch "the third Babylon," may still
be seen the walls of the "apostolic palace," which the popes
and cardinals had long filled with their luxury and debauchery,
and which a Roman legate now inhabited, lonely and dejected
in the midst of this deserted city, whose narrow filthy streets
were seldom trod but by the feet of monks and priests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRANCIS LAMBERT&mdash;HIS NOVICIATE.</div>

<p>The little court of the legate was, however, sometimes
enlivened by a beautiful, amiable, and laughing boy, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
gambolled about its halls.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> This was Francis Lambert, son of
the secretary of the apostolic palace, born in 1487, two years
before Farel. The child was at first astonished at the irreligion
and crimes of these prelates,&mdash;"crimes so numerous
and so enormous," says he, "that I cannot describe them."<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a>
He became habituated to them, however, by degrees, and it
would appear that he was himself seduced by bad example.<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a>
Yet God had implanted in his heart a desire for holiness.
His father being dead, his mother had the charge of his
education, and, according to the custom of the times, intrusted
him to the care of the Franciscans. The sanctified
air of these monks imposed on Francis, and his timid looks
followed them respectfully, as he saw them clad in coarse
garments, barefoot, or with rude sandals only, moving to
and fro, begging in the city and calling on his mother; and
if at any time they chanced to smile upon him, he fancied
himself (he tells us) almost in heaven.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> The monks worked
upon this disposition, and Francis, attracted by them, assumed
the cowl at the age of fifteen. "It was God's pleasure,"
said he in after-years, "that I might make known to the
world the impurity of these whited sepulchres."</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAMBERT'S APOSTOLIC LABORS.</div>

<p>During the year of his noviciate everything went on
smoothly; he was studiously kept in the dark; but no sooner
had he pronounced his vows, than the monks showed themselves
in all their deformity, and the halo of sanctity that he
had discovered around their heads faded away, and he remained
incensed, alarmed, and dejected. Francis soon began
to feel a secret strength within him, that drove him forcibly
towards the Holy Scriptures,<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> and bound him to believe and
to teach the Word of God. In 1517, he was nominated
apostolical preacher of the convent, and instead of running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
about like his colleagues after "fat presents and well-stored
tables," he employed himself in travelling afoot through the
deserted country, and calling those ignorant people to conversion
whom the fire and sincerity of his language drew around
him in crowds. But when, after spending several months
in passing through the Comtat Venaissin and the surrounding
districts, he returned exhausted to his convent on
a mule that had been given him to carry his weakened
frame, and went to seek a brief repose in his poor cell, some
of the monks received him with coldness, others with raillery,
and a third party with anger; and they hastened to sell
the animal, which they all agreed in saying was the only
profit of these evangelical journeys.</p>

<p>One day, as brother Francis was preaching in a certain
town, with a gravity quite apostolic and the vivacity of a
native of the south: "Kindle a fire," exclaimed he, "before
this sacred porch, and there consume the spoils of your
luxury, your worldly-mindedness, and your debauchery."
Immediately the whole assembly was in commotion; some
lighted up a fire; others ran into their houses and returned
with dice, playing-cards, and obscene pictures; and then,
like the Christians of Ephesus at the preaching of St. Paul,
cast all into the flames. A great crowd was gathered round
the fire, and among them some Franciscans, who perceiving
an indecent drawing of a young female, cunningly drew it
away, and hid it under one of their frocks, "to add fuel to
their own flames," says Lambert. This did not escape the
eye of brother Francis; a holy indignation kindled within
him, and boldly addressing the monks, he inveighed against
their lubricity and theft. Abashed at being discovered, they
sunk their heads, gave up the picture, but swore to be revenged.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LAMBERT'S STRUGGLES&mdash;HE QUITS AVIGNON.</div>

<p>Lambert, surrounded with debauchery, and become an object
of hatred to the monks, felt from time to time an ardent
desire to return into the world, which appeared to him infinitely
more holy than the cloister: but he found something
still better. Luther's works, carried to the fairs of Lyons,
descended the Rhone and reached his cell. They were soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
taken from him and burnt; but it was too late. The spirit
that animated the Augustine of Wittemberg had passed into
the Franciscan of Avignon: he was saved. Vainly until
then had he resorted to frequent fasting; vainly had he slept
sitting on a stool;<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> vainly had he shunned the looks of
woman, worn haircloth next his skin, scourged himself, and
so weakened his body that he could scarcely hold himself
upright, and sometimes even fainted in the churches and
fields as he was preaching to the people. All this, he tells
us, could not extinguish the desires and banish the thoughts
that preyed upon him, and it was only in faith on the free
grace of God and in the sanctity of a married life that he
found purity and peace.<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> This is one of those numerous
examples which prove that marriage, being of Divine appointment,
is a means of grace and holiness, and that the
celibacy of priests and monks, the invention of man, is one of
the most effectual agents to foster impurity, sully the imagination,
disturb the peace of families, and fill society with innumerable
disorders.</p>

<p>At last the friar had made up his mind; he will quit the
convent, he will abandon popery, he will leave France. He
will go where the streams of the Gospel flow abundant and
pure, and he will there plunge into them, and quench the
fires that are consuming him.<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> Since all his efforts are
unavailing, he will go to Wittemberg, to that great servant
of God, whose name alone conjures and affrights the devil,
in order that he may find peace.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> He took advantage of
some letters that were to be carried to one of the superiors
of the order, and having donned his frock, quitted the
Franciscan convent of Avignon in the spring of 1522, after
twenty years of struggle. He ascended the Rhone, traversed
Lyons, and crossed the forests that cover the lower ridges of
the Jura. This tall, thin, ungraceful monk still wore the habit
of his order, and rode on an ass, his bare feet almost touching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
the ground. We have already seen him pass through
Geneva, Lausanne, Berne, and Zurich.<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> In the beginning
of 1523, he was at Wittemberg, and embraced Luther. But
let us return to France and to the Church of Meaux.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEFEVRE AND FAREL PERSECUTED.</div>

<p>Lefevre intimidated, Briçonnet drawing back, Farel compelled
to fly&mdash;here was a beginning of victory. They already
imagined at the Sorbonne that they had mastered the movement;
the doctors and monks congratulated each other on
their triumphs. But this was not enough; blood had not
flowed. They set to work again; and blood, since it must
be so, was erelong to gratify the fanaticism of Rome.</p>

<p>The evangelical Christians of Meaux, seeing their leaders
dispersed, sought to edify one another. The wool-carder,
John Leclerc, whom the lessons of the doctors, the reading
of the Bible, and some tracts, had instructed in the christian
doctrine,<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> signalized himself by his zeal and facility in expounding
Scripture. He was one of those men whom the
Spirit of God fills with courage,<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> and soon places at the
head of a religious movement. It was not long before the
Church of Meaux regarded him as its minister.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LUTHERAN AND REFORMED CHURCHES.</div>

<p>The idea of a universal priesthood, such a living principle
among the first Christians, had been re-established by Luther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
in the sixteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> But this idea seems then to
have existed only in theory in the Lutheran church, and to
have been really acted upon solely among the reformed
Christians. The Lutheran Churches (and here they agree
with the Anglican Church) perhaps took a middle course
between the Romish and the Reformed Churches. Among
the Lutherans, everything proceeded from the pastor or the
priest; and nothing was counted valid in the Church that
did not flow regularly through its chiefs. But the Reformed
Churches, while they maintained the Divine appointment of
the ministry, which some sects deny, approached nearer to
the primitive condition of the apostolical communities. From
the times of which we are speaking, they recognised and
proclaimed that the christian flocks ought not simply to
receive what the pastor gives; that the members of the
Church, as well as its leaders, possess the key of that
treasure whence the latter derive their instruction, for the
Bible is in the hands of all; that the graces of God, the spirit
of faith, of wisdom, of consolation, of light, are not bestowed
on the pastor only; that every man is called upon to employ
the gift he has received for the good of all; and that a certain
gift, necessary to the edification of the Church, may be refused
to a minister, and yet granted to one of his flock. Thus
the passive state of the Church was then changed into a
state of general activity; and in France, especially, this
revolution was accomplished. In other countries, the reformers
were almost exclusively pastors and doctors; but in
France men of learning had from the very beginning pious
men of the people for their allies. In that country God
selected for his first workmen a doctor of the Sorbonne and
a wool-comber.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LECLERC'S PLACARDS&mdash;THE BRANDING.</div>

<p>The wool-comber Leclerc began to visit from house to
house, confirming the disciples. But not stopping short at
these ordinary cares, he would fain have seen the edifice of
popery overthrown, and France, from the midst of these ruins,
turning with a cry of joy towards the Gospel. His unguarded
zeal may remind us of that of Hottinger at Zurich, and of
Carlstadt at Wittemberg. He wrote a proclamation against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
the Antichrist of Rome, announcing that the Lord was
about to destroy it by the breath of his mouth. He then
boldly posted his "placards" on the gates of the cathedral.<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a>
Presently all was in confusion around that ancient edifice.
The faithful were amazed; the priests exasperated. What!
a fellow whose employment is wool-combing dares measure
himself with the pope! The Franciscans were outrageous,
and demanded that this once at least a terrible example
should be made. Leclerc was thrown into prison.</p>

<p>His trial was finished in a few days, under the eyes of
Briçonnet himself, who was now to witness and tolerate all
that was done. The carder was condemned to be whipped
three days successively through the city, and on the third
to be branded on the forehead. This sad spectacle soon
began. Leclerc was led through the streets with his hands
bound, his back bare, and the executioners inflicted on him the
blows he had drawn upon himself by rising up against the
Bishop of Rome. An immense crowd followed in the track
marked by the martyr's blood. Some yelled with rage against
the heretic; others by their silence gave him no unequivocal
marks of their tender compassion. One woman encouraged the
unhappy man by her looks and words: she was his mother.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MOTHER'S CRY&mdash;MEETINGS OF BELIEVERS.</div>

<p>At last, on the third day, when the blood-stained procession
was ended, they halted with Leclerc at the usual place
of execution. The hangman prepared the fire, heated the
iron that was to stamp its burning mark on the evangelist,
and approaching him, branded him on the forehead as a
heretic. A shriek was heard, but it did not proceed from
the martyr. His mother, a spectator of the dreadful scene,
and wrung with anguish, endured a bitter strife: it was the
enthusiasm of faith struggling in her heart with maternal
love; faith prevailed at last, and she exclaimed with a voice
that made the adversaries tremble: "Glory to Jesus Christ
and to his witnesses!"<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> Thus did that Frenchwoman of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
sixteenth century fulfil the commandment of the Son of God:
"He that loveth his son more than me is not worthy of me."
Such boldness, and at such a moment, merited signal punishment;
but this christian mother had appalled the hearts
both of priests and soldiers. All their fury was controlled by
a stronger arm than theirs. The crowd, respectfully making
way, allowed the martyr's mother slowly to regain her humble
dwelling. The monks, and even the town-sergeants, gazed
on her without moving. "Not one of her enemies dared lay
hands upon her," said Theodore Beza. After this execution,
Leclerc, being set at liberty, retired to Rosay in Brie, a small
town about six leagues from Meaux, and subsequently to
Metz, where we shall meet with him again.</p>

<p>The adversaries were triumphant. "The Cordeliers having
re-captured the pulpits, propagated their lies and trumpery as
usual."<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> But the poor workmen of the city, prevented from
hearing the Word in regular assemblies, "began to meet
in secret," says our chronicler, "after the manner of the
sons of the prophets in the time of Ahab, and of the Christians
of the primitive Church; and, as opportunity offered,
they assembled at one time in a house, at another in some
cave, sometimes also in a vineyard or in a wood. There, he
amongst them who was most versed in the Holy Scriptures
exhorted the rest; and this done, they all prayed together
with great courage, supporting each other by the hope that
the Gospel would be revived in France, and that the
tyranny of Antichrist would come to an end."<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> There is no
power that can arrest the progress of truth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BERQUIN'S ZEAL&mdash;A DOMICILIARY VISIT.</div>

<p>But one victim only was not enough; and if the first
against whom the persecution was let loose was a wool-comber,
the second was a gentleman of the court. It was
necessary to frighten the nobles as well as the people.
Their reverences of the Sorbonne of Paris could not think of
being outstripped by the Franciscans of Meaux. Berquin,
"the most learned of the nobles," had derived fresh courage
from the Holy Scriptures, and after having attacked "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
hornets of the Sorbonne" in certain epigrams, had openly
accused them of impiety.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></p>

<p>Beda and Duchesne, who had not ventured to reply in
their usual manner to the witticisms of the king's gentleman,
changed their mind, as soon as they discovered serious
convictions latent behind these attacks. Berquin had become
a Christian: his ruin was determined on. Beda and Duchesne,
having seized some of his translations, found in them matter
to burn more heretics than one. "He maintains," said
they, "that it is wrong to invoke the Virgin Mary in place of
the Holy Ghost, and to call her the source of all grace.<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a>
He inveighs against the practice of calling her <i>our hope, our
life</i>, and says that these titles belong only to the Son of
God." There were other matters besides these. Berquin's
study was like a bookseller's shop, whence works of corruption
were circulated through the whole kingdom. The <i>Common-places</i>
of Melancthon, in particular, served, by the elegance of
their style, to shake the faith of the literary men in France.
This pious noble, living only amidst his folios and his <i>tracts</i>,
had become, out of christian charity, translator, corrector,
printer, and bookseller......It was essential to check this formidable
torrent at its very source.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BERQUIN BEFORE THE PARLIAMENT.</div>

<p>One day, as Berquin was quietly seated at his studies,
among his beloved books, his house was suddenly surrounded
by the sergeants-at-arms, who knocked violently at the door.
They were the Sorbonne and its agents, who, furnished with
authority from the parliament, were making a domiciliary
visit. Beda, the formidable syndic, was at their head, and
never did inquisitor perform his duty better; accompanied by
his satellites, he entered Berquin's library, told him his
business, ordered a watchful eye to be kept upon him, and
began his search. Not a book escaped his piercing glance,
and an exact inventory of the whole was drawn up by his
orders. Here was a treatise by Melancthon, there a book
by Carlstadt; farther on, a work of Luther's. Here were
heretical books translated from Latin into French by Berquin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
himself; there, others of his own composition. All the
works that Beda seized, except two, were filled with Lutheran
errors. He left the house, carrying off his booty, and more
elated than ever was general laden with the spoils of vanquished
nations.<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a></p>

<p>Berquin saw that a great storm had burst upon him;
but his courage did not falter. He despised his enemies too
much to fear them. Meanwhile Beda lost no time. On
the 13th of May 1523, the parliament issued a decree that
all the books seized in Berquin's house should be laid before
the faculty of theology. The opinion of the Sorbonne was
soon pronounced; on the 25th of June it condemned all the
works, with the exception of the two already mentioned, to
be burnt as heretical, and ordered that Berquin should abjure
his errors. The parliament ratified this decision.</p>

<p>The nobleman appeared before this formidable body. He
knew that the next step might be to the scaffold; but, like
Luther at Worms, he remained firm. Vainly did the parliament
order him to retract. Berquin was not one of those
<i>who fall away after having been made partakers of the Holy
Ghost</i>. <i>Whosoever is begotten of God, keepeth himself, and
that wicked one toucheth him not.</i><a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> Every fall proves that
the previous conversion has been only apparent or partial;
but Berquin's conversion was real. He replied with firmness
to the court before which he stood. The parliament,
more severe than the Diet of Worms had been, ordered its
officers to seize the accused, and take him to the prison of
the Conciergerie. This was on the 1st of August 1523.
On the 5th the parliament handed over the heretic to the
Bishop of Paris, in order that this prelate might take cognizance
of the affair, and that, assisted by the doctors and
councillors, he should pronounce sentence on the culprit.
He was transferred to the episcopal prison.<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DELIVERED BY FRANCIS I.&mdash;ERASMUS AND BERQUIN.</div>

<p>Thus was Berquin passed from court to court and from
one prison to another. Beda, Duchesne, and their cabal had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
their victim in their grasp; but the court still cherished
a grudge against the Sorbonne, and Francis was more
powerful than Beda. This transaction excited great indignation
among the nobles. Do these monks and priests
forget what the sword of a gentleman is worth? "Of what
is he accused?" said they to Francis I.; "of blaming the
custom of invoking the Virgin in place of the Holy Ghost?
But Erasmus and many others blame it likewise. Is it for
such trifles that they imprison a king's officer?<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> This
attack is aimed at literature, true religion, the nobility, chivalry,
nay the crown itself." The king was glad to have
another opportunity of vexing the whole company. He
issued letters transferring the cause to the royal council, and
on the 8th of August an usher appeared at the bishop's
prison with an order from the king to set Berquin at liberty.</p>

<p>The question now was whether the monks would give
way. Francis I., who had anticipated some resistance, said to
the agent commissioned to execute his orders: "If you meet
with any resistance, I authorize you to break open the
gates." This language was clear. The monks and the Sorbonne
submitted to the affront, and Berquin being restored
to liberty appeared before the king's council, by which he
was acquitted.<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a></p>

<p>Thus did Francis I. humiliate the Church. Berquin imagined
that France, under his reign, might emancipate herself
from the papacy, and had thoughts of renewing the war.
For this purpose he entered into communication with Erasmus,
who at once recognised him as a man of worth.<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> But,
ever timid and temporizing, the philosopher said to him:
"Beware of treading on a hornet's nest, and pursue your
studies in peace.<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> Above all, do not mix me up with your
affair; that would neither serve you nor me."<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a></p>

<p>This rebuff did not discourage Berquin; if the mightiest
genius of the age draws back, he will put his trust in God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
who never falters. God's work will be done either with or
without the aid of man. "Berquin," said Erasmus, "had
some resemblance to the palm-tree; he rose up again, and
became proud and towering against those who sought to
alarm him."<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MAZURIER'S APOSTACY.</div>

<p>Such were not all who had embraced the evangelical doctrine.
Martial Mazurier had been one of the most zealous
preachers. He was accused of teaching very erroneous
opinions,<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> and even of having committed certain acts of violence
while at Meaux. "This Martial Mazurier, being at
Meaux," says a manuscript of that city, which we have
already quoted, "going to the church of the reverend
Grayfriars, and seeing the image of St. Francis, with the
five wounds, outside the convent-gate, where that of St.
Roch now stands, threw it down and broke it in pieces."
Mazurier was apprehended, and sent to the Conciergerie,<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a>
where he suddenly fell into deep reflection and severe anguish.
It was the morality rather than the doctrine of the Gospel
that had attracted him to the ranks of the reformers; and
morality left him without strength. Alarmed at the prospect
of the stake, and decidedly of opinion that in France
the victory would remain on the side of Rome, he easily
persuaded himself that he would enjoy more influence and
honour by returning to the papacy. Accordingly he retracted
what he had taught, and caused doctrines the very
opposite of those he had previously held to be preached in
his parish;<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> and subsequently joining the most fanatical
doctors, and particularly the celebrated Ignatius Loyola, he
became from that time the most zealous supporter of the
papal cause.<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> From the days of the Emperor Julian,

most merciless persecutors of the doctrines they had once
professed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FALL AND CONTRITION OF PAVANNE.</div>

<p>Mazurier soon found an opportunity of showing his zeal.
The youthful James Pavanne had also been thrown into
prison. Martial hoped that, by making him fall like himself,
he might cover his own shame. The youth, amiability,
learning, and uprightness of Pavanne, created a general interest
in his favour, and Mazurier imagined that he would
himself be less culpable, if he could persuade Master James
to follow his example. He visited him in prison, and began
his man&oelig;uvres by pretending that he had advanced further
than Pavanne in the knowledge of the truth: "You are
mistaken, James," he often repeated to him; "you have not
gone to the depths of the sea; you only know the surface
of the waters."<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> Nothing was spared, neither sophistry,
promises, nor threats. The unhappy youth, seduced, agitated,
and shaken, sunk at last under these perfidious
attacks, and publicly retracted his pretended errors on the
morrow of Christmas-day 1524. But from that hour a
spirit of dejection and remorse was sent on Pavanne by the
Almighty. A deep sadness preyed upon him, and he was
continually sighing. "Alas!" repeated he, "there is
nothing but bitterness for me in life." Sad wages of unbelief!</p>

<div class="sidenote">METZ&mdash;AGRIPPA AND CHATELAIN.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, among those who had received the Word of
God in France, were men of more intrepid spirit than Mazurier
and Pavanne. About the end of the year 1523, Leclerc
had withdrawn to Metz in Lorraine, and there, says Theodore
Beza, he had followed the example of Saint Paul at Corinth,
who, while working at his trade as a tentmaker, persuaded
the Jews and the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> Leclerc, still pursuing his
occupation as a wool-carder, instructed the people of his
own condition; and many of them had been really converted.
Thus did this humble artisan lay the foundation
of a church which afterwards became celebrated.</p>

<p>Leclerc was not the first individual who had endeavoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
to shed the new light of the Gospel over Metz. A scholar,
renowned in that age for his skill in the occult sciences,
Master Agrippa of Nettesheim, "a marvellously learned
clerk, of small stature, who had spent much time in travel,
who spoke every language, and had studied every science,"<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>
had fixed his residence at Metz, and had even become
syndic of the city. Agrippa had procured Luther's works,
and communicated them to his friends,<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>and among others
to Master John, priest of Sainte-Croix, himself a great clerk,
and with whom Master Agrippa was very intimate. Many
of the clergy, nobility, and citizens, stirred by the courage
Luther had shown at Worms, were gained over to his cause,<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a>
and already in March 1522, an evangelical placard extolling
what Luther had done was posted in large letters on a
corner of the episcopal palace, and excited much public
attention. But when Leclerc arrived, the flames, for an
instant overpowered, sprung up with renewed energy. In
the council-room, in the hall of the chapter, and in the
homes of the citizens, the conversation turned perpetually on
the Lutheran business. "Many great clerks and learned
persons were daily questioning, discussing, and debating
this matter, and for the most part taking Luther's side, and
already preaching and proclaiming that accursed sect."<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<p>Erelong the evangelical cause received a powerful reinforcement.
"About this same time (1524)," says the
chronicle, "there came to Metz an Augustine friar named
John Chaistellain (Chatelain), a man declining in years, and
of agreeable manners, a great preacher and very eloquent, a
wondrous comforter to the poorer sort. By which means
he gained the good-will of most of the people (not of all),
especially of the majority of the priests and great rabbins,
against whom the said friar John preached daily, setting
forth their vices and their sins, saying that they abused the
poor people, by which great animosity was stirred up."<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LAMBERT AT WITTEMBERG.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>John Chatelain, an Augustine monk of Tournay, and
doctor of divinity, had been brought to the knowledge of
God<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> by his intercourse with the Augustines of Antwerp.
The doctrine of Christ, when preached by him attired in
chasuble and stole, appeared less extraordinary to the inhabitants
of Metz, than when it fell from the lips of a poor
artisan, who laid aside the comb with which he carded his
wool, to explain a French version of the Gospel.</p>

<p>Everything was fermenting in Metz during that famous
Lent of 1524, when a new character appeared on the stage,
a priest, a doctor, an ex-friar, and (what had never yet been
seen in France or Lorraine) having a wife with him.<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> This
was Lambert of Avignon.</p>

<p>On Lambert's arrival at Wittemberg, which had been the
object of his journey on leaving the convent, he was well
received by Luther, and the reformer had hastened to recommend
to Spalatin and to the elector this friar, who, "on
account of persecution, had chosen poverty and exile......He
pleases me in all respects," added Luther.<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> Lambert had
begun to lecture on the prophet Hosea at the university,
before an auditory who could not conceal their surprise at
hearing such things from the mouth of a Gaul.<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> And then,
with eyes ever turned towards his native land, he had begun
to translate into French and Italian several evangelical
pamphlets published by Luther and other doctors. He was
not the only Frenchman at Wittemberg: he there met with
counts, knights, nobles, and others come from France to see
the elector and to converse with Luther, "the overseer of
the works that were accomplishing in the world."<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> These
Frenchmen mutually encouraged each other, and, as is usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
with emigrants, exaggerated the state of affairs, imagining
that a speedy revolution would lead to the triumph
in their own country of the cause which they had so much
at heart. "Almost the whole of Gaul is stirring," wrote
Lambert to the Elector of Saxony. "Although in France
the truth has no master and no leader, its friends are very
numerous."<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">EVANGELICAL PRESS AT HAMBURG.</div>

<p>One thing alone checked these Frenchmen at Wittemberg:
the printing of the pamphlets intended for their countrymen.
"Would that I could find some one," exclaimed Lambert,
"that could print not only in Latin, but in French and even
in Italian."<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> This was the posture of affairs when certain
strangers appeared: they were from Hamburg. "We come
to ask you for some French treatises," said they to Lambert;
"for we have some one in Hamburg who will print
them carefully."<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> It would appear that there were also a
number of French emigrants at Hamburg, and a printer
among the rest. Lambert could not restrain his joy; but
there was still another difficulty: "And how," said he, "can
we convey these books into France from the banks of the
Elbe?"&mdash;"By sea; by the vessels that sail to and fro," replied
the Hamburgers.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> "Every necessary arrangement
has been made." Thus the Gospel had hardly been restored
to the Church, before the ocean became an instrument of
its dissemination. <i>The Lord hath made a way in the sea.</i><a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a></p>

<p>Yet this could not suffice; every Frenchman returning
into France was to carry a few books with him, although
the scaffold might be the reward of his enterprise. <i>Now</i>
there is more talking, <i>then</i> there was more action. A young
French nobleman, Claude of Taureau, who left Wittemberg
in May 1523, took with him a great number of evangelical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
treatises and letters which Lambert had written to many of
the most conspicuous men of France and Savoy.<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LAMBERT'S MARRIAGE&mdash;LONGINGS FOR FRANCE.</div>

<p>On the 13th of July 1523, Lambert, then at the age of
thirty-six, "determined (in his own words) to flee the paths
of impurity as he had always done," entered into the holy
bonds of wedlock, two years before Luther, and the first of
the French monks or priests. When married, he called to
mind that he ought not to think "how he might please his
wife, but how he might please the Lord." Christina, the
daughter of a worthy citizen of Herzberg, was ready to be
the companion of his sufferings. Lambert told his Wittemberg
friends that he intended returning to France.</p>

<p>Luther and Melancthon were terrified at the thought.
"It is rather from France to Germany," said Luther, "than
from Germany to France, that you should go."<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> Lambert,
all whose thoughts were in France, paid no attention to the
reformers advice.<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LOTS.</div>

<p>And yet Luther's sentiments could not fail to make some
impression on him. Should he go to Zurich, whither Luther
urges him? or to France or Lorraine, where Farel and, as
he believes, Christ himself are calling him? He was in
great perplexity.<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> At Zurich he would find peace and
safety; in France peril and death.<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> His rest was broken,
he could find no repose;<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> he wandered through the streets
of Wittemberg with downcast eyes, and his wife could not
restore him to serenity. At last he fell on his knees, and
called upon the Lord to put an end to his struggle, by making
known His will in the casting of lots.<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> He took two
slips of paper; on one he wrote <i>France</i>, on the other <i>Switzerland</i>;
he closed his eyes and drew; the lot had fallen on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
France.<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> Again he fell on his knees: "O God," said he,
"if thou wilt not close these lips that desire to utter thy
praise, deign to make known thy pleasure."<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> Again he
tried, and the answer still was <i>France</i>. And some hours
after, recollecting (said he) that Gideon, when called to march
against the Midianites, had thrice asked for a sign from
heaven near the oak of Ophrah,<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> he prayed God a third time,
and a third time the lot replied <i>France</i>. From that hour he
hesitated no longer, and Luther, who could not put such
confidence in the lot, for the sake of peace, ceased urging
his objections, and Lambert, in the month of February or
March 1524, taking his wife with him, departed for Strasburg,
whence he repaired to Metz.</p>

<p>He soon became intimate with Chatelain, whom he called
"his Jonathan," and appearing before a meeting commissioned
to inquire into his doctrines: "Suffer me to preach in
public," said the man of Avignon, "and I will forthwith
publish one hundred and sixteen theses explanatory of my
doctrine, and which I will defend against all manner of
persons."</p>

<p>The Chamber of XIII., messieurs the clerks, and messeigneurs
of justice, before whom Lambert had been called, were
frightened at such a request, and refused permission; and
shortly after, the whole troop of Antichrist was in commotion,
said Lambert; canons, monks, inquisitors, the
bishop's officials, and all their partisans, endeavoured to seize
and throw him into the dungeon of some cloister.<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> The
magistrates protected Lambert, but intimated that he had
better leave the city. Lambert obeyed. "I will flee," said
he to his Master, "but will still confess thy name! Whenever
it be thy good pleasure, I will endure death. I am in
thy hands; I flee, and yet I flee not; it is the flight which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
becometh all those who are made perfect."<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> Lambert had not
been a fortnight in Metz. He was to learn that God makes
known his will by other means than the drawing of lots. It
was not for France that this monk from the banks of the
Rhone was destined; we shall soon behold him playing an
important part in Germany, as reformer of Hesse. He returned
to Strasburg, leaving Chatelain and Leclerc at Metz.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PETER TOUSSAINT.</div>

<p>Owing to the zeal of these two men the light of the Gospel
spread more and more through the whole city. A very
devout woman, named Toussaint, of the middle rank, had a
son called Peter, with whom, in the midst of his sports, she
would often converse in a serious strain. Everywhere, even
in the homes of the townspeople, something extraordinary
was expected. One day the child, indulging in the amusements
natural to his age, was riding on a stick in his mother's
room, when the latter, conversing with her friends on the
things of God, said to them with an agitated voice: "Antichrist
will soon come with great power, and destroy those
who have been converted at the preaching of Elias."<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> These
words being frequently repeated attracted the child's attention,
and he recollected them long after. Peter Toussaint
was no longer a child when the doctor of theology and the
wool-comber were preaching the Gospel at Metz. His relations
and friends, surprised at his youthful genius, hoped to
see him one day filling an eminent station in the Church.
One of his uncles, his father's brother, was dean of Metz;
it was the highest dignity in the chapter.<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> The Cardinal
John of Lorraine, son of Duke René, who maintained a large
establishment, testified much regard for the dean and his
nephew. The latter, notwithstanding his youth, had just
obtained a prebend, when he began to lend an attentive ear
to the Gospel. Might not the preaching of Chatelain and
Leclerc be that of Elias? It is true, Antichrist is already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
arming against it in every quarter. But it matters not. "Let
us lift up our heads to the Lord," said he, "for he will come
and will not tarry."<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">D'ESCH&mdash;THE IMAGES.</div>

<p>The evangelical doctrine was making its way into the first
families of Metz. The chevalier D'Esch, a man highly respected,
and the dean's intimate friend, had just been converted.<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a>
The friends of the Gospel rejoiced. "The knight,
our worthy master,"......repeated Peter, adding with noble
candour; "if, however, we are permitted to have a master
upon earth."<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a></p>

<p>Thus Metz was about to become a focus of light, when
the imprudent zeal of Leclerc suddenly arrested this slow but
sure progress, and aroused a storm that threatened utter
ruin to the rising church. The common people of Metz
continued walking in their old superstitions, and Leclerc's
heart was vexed at seeing this great city plunged in "idolatry."
One of their great festivals was approaching. About
a league from the city stood a chapel containing images
of the Virgin and of the most celebrated saints of the country,
and whither all the inhabitants of Metz were in the
habit of making a pilgrimage on a certain day in the year,
to worship the images and to obtain the pardon of their
sins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE IMAGES BROKEN&mdash;THE PROCESSION.</div>

<p>The eve of the festival had arrived: Leclerc's pious and
courageous soul was violently agitated. Has not God said:
<i>Thou shalt not bow down to their gods; but thou shalt utterly
overthrow them, and quite break down their images?</i><a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> Leclerc
thought that this command was addressed to him, and without
consulting either Chatelain, Esch, or any of those whom
he might have suspected would have dissuaded him,
quitted the city in the evening, just as night was coming
on, and approached the chapel. There he pondered a while
sitting silently before the statues. He still had it in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
power to withdraw; but......to-morrow, in a few hours, the
whole city that should worship God alone will be kneeling
down before these blocks of wood and stone. A struggle
ensued in the wool-comber's bosom, like that which we
trace in so many Christians of the primitive ages of the
Church. What matters it to him that what he sees are the
images of saints, and not of heathen gods and goddesses?
Does not the worship which the people pay to these images
belong to God alone? Like Polyeucte before the idols in
the temple, his heart shudders, his courage revives:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ne perdons plus de temps, le sacrifice est prêt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Allons y du vrai Dieu soutenir l'intérêt;<br /></span>

<span class="i14"><i>Corneille, Polyeucte.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Leclerc arose, approached the images, took them down
and broke them in pieces, indignantly scattering their fragments
before the altar. He doubted not that the Spirit of
the Lord had excited him to this action, and Theodore Beza
thinks the same.<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> After this, Leclerc returned to Metz,
which he entered at daybreak, unnoticed save by a few persons
as he was entering the gates.<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LECLERC CONDEMNED AND TORTURED.</div>

<p>Meanwhile all were in motion in the ancient city; bells
were ringing; the brotherhoods were assembling; and the
whole population of Metz, headed by the canons, priests,
and monks, went forth in solemn procession; they recited
prayers or sung hymns to the saints they were going to
adore; crosses and banners moved on in due order, and instruments
of music or drums responded to the voices of the
faithful. At length, after nearly an hour's march, the procession
reached the place of pilgrimage. But what was
the astonishment of the priests, when advancing, censer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
hand, they discovered the images they had come to worship
mutilated and covering the earth with their fragments.
They recoiled with horror, and announced this sacrilegious
act to the crowd. Suddenly the chanting ceased, the
instruments were silent, the banners lowered, and the
whole multitude was in a state of indescribable agitation.
The canons, priests, and monks endeavoured to inflame their
minds, and excited the people to search for the criminal,
and demand his death.<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> But one cry burst from every lip:
"Death, death to the sacrilegious wretch!" They returned
to Metz in haste and in disorder.</p>

<p>Leclerc was known to all; many times he had called the
images idols. Besides had he not been seen at daybreak
returning from the direction of the chapel. He was seized;
he immediately confessed his crime, and conjured the people
to worship God alone. But this language still further exasperated
the fury of the multitude, who would have dragged
him to instant death. When led before his judges, he boldly
declared that Jesus Christ, God manifest in the flesh, should
alone be adored. He was sentenced to be burnt alive, and
taken out to the place of execution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MARTYR'S COURAGE&mdash;CHATELAIN BURNT.</div>

<p>Here a fearful scene awaited him. The cruelty of his
persecutors had been contriving all that could render his
punishment more horrible. Near the scaffold men were
heating pincers that were to serve as the instruments of
their rage. Leclerc, firm and calm, heard unmoved the
wild yells of the monks and people. They began by cutting
off his right hand; then taking up the burning pincers,
they tore off his nose; after this, they lacerated his arms, and
when they had thus mangled them in several places, they
concluded by burning his breasts.<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> While his enemies were in
this manner wreaking their vengeance on his body, Leclerc's
mind was at rest. He recited solemnly and with a loud
voice<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> these words of David: <i>Their idols are silver and</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>

walk not; neither speak they through their throat. They
that make them are like unto them; so is every one that
trusteth in them. O Israel, trust thou in the Lord; he is
their help and their shield.</i> (Psalm cxv. 4-9). The sight
of such fortitude daunted the enemies, and strengthened
the faithful;<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> the people, who had before shown so much
anger, were astonished and touched with compassion.<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a>
After these tortures Leclerc was burnt by a slow fire, in
conformity with his sentence. Such was the death of the
first martyr of the Gospel in France.</p>

<p>But the priests of Metz were not satisfied. In vain
had they endeavoured to shake the constancy of Chatelain.
"He is deaf as an adder," said they, "and refuses to hear
the truth."<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> He was seized by the creatures of the Cardinal
of Lorraine and carried to the castle of Nommeny.</p>

<p>He was then degraded by the bishop's officers, who stripped
him of his priestly vestments, and scraped his fingers with a
piece of glass, saying: "By this scraping, we deprive thee of
the power to sacrifice, consecrate, and bless, which thou receivedst
by the anointing of hands."<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> Then, throwing over
him a layman's dress, they surrendered him to the secular
power, which condemned him to be burnt alive. The pile
was soon erected, and the minister of Christ consumed by
the flames. "Lutheranism spread not the less through the
whole district of Metz," say the authors of the history of the
Gallican Church, who in other respects highly approve of this
severity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL AND HIS BROTHERS.</div>

<p>As soon as this storm began to beat upon the Church
at Metz, tribulation had entered into Toussaint's family.
His uncle, the dean, without taking an active part in the
measures directed against Leclerc and Chatelain, shuddered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
at the thought that his nephew was one of their party.
His mother's alarm was greater still. There was not a
moment to lose; the liberty and life of all who had lent
their ear to the Gospel were endangered. The blood that
the inquisitors had shed had only increased their thirst:
more scaffolds would erelong be raised. Peter Toussaint, the
knight Esch, and many others, hastily quitted Metz, and
sought refuge at Basle.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Farel and his Brothers&mdash;Farel expelled from Gap&mdash;He preaches in the
Fields&mdash;The Knight Anemond of Coct&mdash;The Minorite&mdash;Anemond quits
France&mdash;Luther to the Duke of Savoy&mdash;Farel quits France.</p></blockquote>


<p>Thus violently did the gale of persecution blow at Meaux and
at Metz. The north of France rejected the Gospel: the Gospel
for a while gave way. But the Reformation only changed
its ground; and the provinces of the south-east became the
scene of action.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL EXPELLED FROM GAP&mdash;RURAL PREACHING.</div>

<p>Farel, who had taken refuge at the foot of the Alps, was
there labouring with great activity. It was of little moment
to him to enjoy the sweets of domestic life in the bosom of
his family. The rumour of what had taken place at Meaux
and at Paris had filled his brothers with a certain degree of
terror; but an unknown power was drawing them towards
the new and admirable things on which William conversed
with them. The latter besought them with all the impetuosity
of his zeal to be converted to the Gospel;<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> and
Daniel, Walter, and Claude were at last won over to that
God whom their brother announced. They did not at first
abandon the religious worship of their forefathers; but,
when persecution arose, they courageously sacrificed their
friends, their property, and their country to worship Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
Christ in freedom.<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> The brothers of Luther and of Zwingle
do not appear to have been so decidedly converted to the
Gospel; the French Reform from its very commencement had
a more tender and domestic character.</p>

<p>Farel did not confine his exhortations to his brethren; he
proclaimed the truth to his relations and friends at Gap and
in the neighbourhood. It would even appear, if we may
credit a manuscript, that, profiting by the friendship of
certain clergymen, he began to preach the Gospel in several
churches;<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> but other authorities positively declare that he did
not at this time ascend the pulpit. However this may be,
the doctrine he professed caused great agitation. The multitude
and the clergy desired to silence him. "What new
and strange heresy is this?" said they; "must all the practices
of piety be counted vain? He is neither monk nor
priest: he has no business to preach."<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a></p>

<p>Erelong all the civil and ecclesiastical powers of Gap
combined against Farel. He was evidently an agent of that
sect which the whole country is opposing. "Let us cast
this firebrand of discord far from us," they exclaimed.
Farel was summoned to appear, harshly treated, and violently
expelled from the city.<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a></p>

<p>He did not, however, abandon his native country: were
there not in the fields, the villages, the banks of the Durance,
of the Guisanne, and of the Isère many souls that stood in
need of the Gospel? and if he incurred any danger, could
he not find an asylum in those forests, caverns, and steep
rocks that he had so often traversed in his youth? He
began, therefore, to go through the country preaching in
private houses and in solitary fields, and seeking an asylum
in the woods and on the brink of torrents.<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> This was a school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
in which God trained him for other labours. "The crosses,
persecutions, and machinations of Satan, of which I was
forewarned, have not been wanting," said he; "they are
even much severer than I could have borne of myself; but
God is my father; He has provided and always will provide
me the strength which I require."<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> A great number of the
inhabitants of these rural districts received the truth from
his lips. Thus the persecution that had driven Farel from
Paris and from Meaux, contributed to the spread of the Reformation
in the provinces of the Saone, of the Rhone, and
of the Alps. Every age has witnessed the fulfilment of the
saying of Scripture: <i>They that were scattered abroad went
everywhere preaching the Word</i>.<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ANEMOND DE COCT.</div>

<p>Among the Frenchmen who were at that time gained over
to the Gospel was a gentleman of Dauphiny, the chevalier
Anemond de Coct, younger son of the auditor of Coct, lord
of Châtelard. He was active, ardent, and lively, sincerely
pious, and a foe to relics, processions, and the clergy; he
received the evangelical doctrine with great alacrity, and
was soon entirely devoted to it. He could not endure forms
in religion, and would gladly have abolished all the ceremonies
of the Church. The religion of the heart, the inward
worship, was in his view the only true one. "Never," said
he, "has my spirit found any rest in externals. The sum
of Christianity is comprised in these words: <i>John truly baptized
with water, but ye shall be baptized with the Holy
Ghost; ye must put on the new man</i>."<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a></p>

<p>Coct, endued with all the vivacity of a Frenchman, spoke
and wrote at one time in Latin, at another in French. He
read and quoted Donatus, Thomas Aquinas, Juvenal, and
the Bible! His style was abrupt, passing suddenly from one
idea to another. Ever in motion, he presented himself
wherever a door seemed open to the Gospel, or a celebrated
doctor was to be heard. By his cordiality he won the hearts
of all his acquaintances. "He is distinguished by rank and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
learning," said Zwingle at a later period, "but more distinguished
still for piety and affability."<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> Anemond is the
type of many of the reformed Frenchmen. Vivacity, simple-heartedness,
zeal sometimes carried even to imprudence, are
the qualities often found in those of his fellow-countrymen
who embraced the Gospel. But at the opposite extreme of
the French character we find the serious features of Calvin,
a weighty counterpoise to the levity of Coct. Calvin and
Anemond are the two poles between which revolves the
whole religious world in France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANEMOND'S FAMILY&mdash;THE MINORITE FRIAR.</div>

<p>No sooner had Anemond received the knowledge of Jesus
Christ from Farel,<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> than he sought himself to gain converts
to that doctrine of spirit and of life. His father was dead;
his elder brother, of harsh and haughty temper, disdainfully
repelled him. Lawrence, the youngest of the family, and
who loved him sincerely, seemed but half to understand him.
Anemond, finding himself rejected by his own kindred,
turned his activity to another quarter.</p>

<p>Hitherto the awakening in Dauphiny had been confined
solely to the laity. Farel, Anemond, and their friends, desired
to see a priest at the head of this movement, which
seemed as if it would shake the provinces of the Alps. There
dwelt at Grenoble a minorite priest, Peter Sebville by
name, a preacher of great eloquence, of an honest and good
heart, not taking counsel with flesh and blood, and whom
God was gradually attracting to him.<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> Sebville soon became
aware that there is no infallible teacher but the Word
of God; and, abandoning the doctrines that are supported
on human testimony alone, he determined in his own mind
to preach the Word "purely, clearly, and holily."<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> In
these three words the whole of the Reformation is summed
up. Coct and Farel were delighted as they heard this new
preacher of grace raising his eloquent voice in their province,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
and thought that their own presence would henceforward be
less necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANEMOND QUITS FRANCE AND VISITS LUTHER.</div>

<p>The more the awakening spread, the more violent became the
opposition. Anemond, desirous of becoming acquainted with
Luther and Zwingle, and of visiting those countries where the
Reformation had originated, and indignant at the rejection of
the Gospel by his fellow-countrymen, resolved to bid farewell
to his home and his family. He made his will, disposing of
his property, at that time in the hands of his elder brother,
the lord of Châtelard, in favour of his brother Lawrence;<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>
and then quitting Dauphiny and France, he made
his way with all the impetuosity of the south, through countries
which it was no easy matter in that age to traverse, and
passing through Switzerland, hardly stopping at Basle, he
arrived at Wittemberg, where Luther was residing. This
was shortly after the second Diet of Nuremberg. The French
gentleman accosted the Saxon doctor with his usual vivacity;
talked with him enthusiastically about the Gospel,
and eagerly laid before him the plans he had formed for the
propagation of the truth. The gravity of the Saxon smiled
at the southern imagination of the chevalier;<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> and Luther,
notwithstanding certain prejudices against the French character,
was fascinated and carried away by Anemond. He
was affected by the thought that this gentleman had come
from France to Wittemberg for the sake of the Gospel.<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a>
"Assuredly," said the reformer to his friends, "this French
knight is an excellent, learned, and pious man."<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> The
young noble produced the same impression on Zwingle and
on Luther.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANEMOND AND LUTHER&mdash;LUTHER TO THE DUKE OF SAVOY.</div>

<p>Anemond, seeing what Luther and Zwingle had done,
thought that if they would turn their attention to France and
Savoy, nothing could resist them. Accordingly, as he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
not prevail on them to go thither, he begged them at least
to write. In particular, he requested Luther to address a
letter to Duke Charles of Savoy, brother to Louisa and Philiberta,
and uncle to Francis I. and Margaret. "This prince,"
said he to the doctor, "feels great attraction towards piety
and true religion,<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> and loves to converse on the Reformation
with some of the persons about his court. He is just the
man to understand you; for his motto is this: <i>Nihil deest
timentibus Deum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> and this device is yours also. Injured in
turns by the empire and by France, humiliated, vexed, and
always in danger, his heart stands in need of God and of his
grace: all that he wants is a powerful impulse. If he were
won to the Gospel, he would have an immense influence on
Switzerland, Savoy, and France. Write to him, I beseech
you."</p>

<p>Luther was wholly German in character, and would have
found himself ill at ease out of Germany; yet, animated by
a true catholicism, he stretched out his hands as soon as
he saw brethren, and in every place when there was any
word of exhortation to be given, he took care that it should
be heard. He sometimes wrote on the same day to the
farthest parts of Europe, to the Low Countries, to Savoy, and
to Livonia.</p>

<p>"Assuredly," replied he to Anemond's request, "a love
for the Gospel is a rare gift, and an inestimable jewel in a
prince."<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> And he addressed a letter to the duke, which
Anemond probably carried as far as Switzerland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUTHER'S FAITH AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.</div>

<p>"May your highness pardon me," wrote Luther, "If I, a
weak and despised man, presume to address you; or rather
ascribe this boldness to the glory of the Gospel; for I cannot
see that glorious light rising and shining in any quarter
without exulting at the joyful sight......It is my desire that
my Lord Jesus Christ should gain many souls by the example
of your most serene highness. And for this reason I desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
to set our doctrine before you......We believe that the commencement
of salvation and the sum of Christianity is faith
in Christ, who by his blood alone, and not by our works, has
made atonement for sin, and put an end to the dominion of
death. We believe that this faith is a gift of God, and that
it is created by the Holy Ghost in our hearts, and not found
by our own labours. For faith is a living thing,<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> which spiritually
begetteth the man, and maketh him a new creature."</p>

<p>Luther then proceeded to the consequences of faith, and
showed how it could not be possessed without sweeping
away the whole scaffolding of false doctrines and human
works that the Church had so laboriously raised. "If grace,"
said he, "is obtained by Christ's blood, it is not by our own
works. This is the reason why all the labours of all the
cloisters are unavailing, and these institutions should be
abolished, as being contrary to the blood of Jesus Christ, and
leading men to trust in their own good works. Ingrafted in
Christ, nothing remains for us but to do good, for having
become good trees, we should bear witness to it by good
fruits.</p>

<p>"Gracious prince and lord," said Luther in conclusion,
"may your highness, who has made so happy a beginning,
help to propagate this doctrine; not with the power of the
sword, which would injure the Gospel, but by inviting into
your states learned doctors who may preach the Word. It
is by the breath of his mouth that Jesus will destroy Antichrist,
in order that, as Daniel says (chap. viii. ver. 25), he
may be broken without hand. For this reason, most serene
prince, may your highness fan the spark that has been
kindled in your heart; may a flame go forth from the house
of Savoy, as in former times from the house of Joseph;<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a>
may all France be consumed like stubble before that fire;
may it burn, blaze, and purify, so that this illustrious kingdom
may truly be called <i>most christian</i>, for which it is indebted,
up to this hour, solely to the rivers of blood shed in
the service of Antichrist."</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL QUITS FRANCE.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>Thus did Luther endeavour to diffuse the Gospel in France.
We are ignorant of the effect produced on the prince by this
letter; but we do not see that he ever showed any desire to
separate from Rome. In 1522, he requested Adrian VI. to
stand godfather to his eldest son; and, shortly after, the
pope promised a cardinal's hat for his second son. Anemond,
after making an effort to see the court and the Elector of
Saxony, and having received a letter from Luther for this
purpose,<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> returned to Basle, more decided than ever to expose
his life for the Gospel. In his ardour, he would have
rejoiced to possess the power of rousing the whole of France.
"All that I am," said he, "all that I shall be, all that I
have, all that I shall have, I am determined to consecrate to
the glory of God."<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a></p>

<p>Anemond found his compatriot Farel at Basle. Anemond's
letters had excited in him a great desire to see the
reformers of Switzerland and Germany. Moreover, Farel
required a sphere of activity in which he could more freely
exert his strength. He therefore quitted that France which
already offered nothing but scaffolds and the stake for the
preachers of the unadulterated Gospel. Following byroads
and concealing himself in the woods, he escaped, although
with difficulty, from the hands of his enemies. Often had he
lost his way. At last he reached Switzerland at the beginning
of 1524. There he was destined to spend his life in the
service of the Gospel, and it was then that France began to
send into Helvetia those noble-minded evangelists who were
to establish the Reformation in Switzerland <i>Romande</i>,<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> and
to give it a new and powerful impulse in other parts of the
confederation and in the whole world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Catholicity of the Reformation&mdash;Friendship between Farel and &OElig;colampadius&mdash;Farel
and Erasmus&mdash;Altercation&mdash;Farel demands a Disputation&mdash;Theses&mdash;Scripture
and Faith&mdash;Discussion.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">CATHOLICITY OF THE REFORMATION</div>

<p>The catholicity of the Reformation is a noble feature in its
character. The Germans pass into Switzerland; the French
into Germany; in latter times men from England and Scotland
pass over to the continent, and doctors from the continent
into Great Britain. The reformers in the different
countries spring up almost independently of one another;
but no sooner are they born than they hold out the hand of
fellowship. There is among them one sole faith, one spirit,
one Lord. It has been an error, in our opinion, to write,
as hitherto, the history of the Reformation for a single
country; the work is one, and from their very origin the
Protestant Churches form "a whole body, fitly jointed together."<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a></p>

<p>Many refugees from France and Lorraine at this time
formed at Basle a French Church, whose members had
escaped from the scaffold. They had spoken there of Farel,
of Lefevre, and of the occurrences at Meaux; and when the
former arrived in Switzerland, he was already known as one
of the most devoted champions of the Gospel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRIENDSHIP OF &OElig;COLAMPADIUS AND FAREL.</div>

<p>He was immediately taken to &OElig;colampadius, who had
returned to Basle some time before. Rarely does it happen
that two men of more opposite character are brought together.
&OElig;colampadius charmed by his mildness, Farel
carried away his hearers by his impetuosity: but from the
first moment these two men felt themselves united for ever.<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a>
It was another meeting of a Luther and Melancthon.
&OElig;colampadius received Farel into his house, gave him an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
humble chamber, a frugal table, and introduced him to his
friends; and it was not long before the learning, piety, and
courage of the young Frenchman gained every heart. Pellican,
Imeli, Wolfhard, and other ministers of Basle felt themselves
strengthened in the faith by his energetic language.
&OElig;colampadius was at that time much depressed in spirit:
"Alas!" said he to Zwingle, "I speak in vain, and see not
the least reason to hope. Perhaps among the Turks I
might meet with greater success!<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a>......Alas!" added he
with a deep sigh, "I lay the blame on myself alone." But
the more he saw of Farel, the more his heart cheered up,
and the courage he received from the Dauphinese became the
ground-work of an undying affection. "O my dear Farel,"
said he, "I hope that the Lord will make our friendship
immortal, and if we cannot live together here below, our joy
will only be the greater when we shall be united at Christ's
right hand in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> Pious and affecting thoughts!......Farel's
arrival was for Switzerland evidently a succour
from on high.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL AND ERASMUS.</div>

<p>But while this Frenchman was delighted with &OElig;colampadius,
he shrank coldly and with noble pride from a man
at whose feet all the nations of Christendom fell prostrate.
The prince of the schools, he from whom every one coveted
a word or a look, the master of the age&mdash;Erasmus&mdash;was
neglected by Farel. The young Dauphinese had refused to
go and pay homage to the old sage of Rotterdam, despising
those men who are only by halves on the side of the truth,
and who, though clearly aware of the consequences of error,
are full of forbearance towards those who propagate it. Thus
we witness in Farel that decision which has become one of
the distinctive characters of the Reformation in France and
French Switzerland, and which some have called stiffness,
exclusiveness, and intolerance. A controversy, arising out
of the commentaries of the doctor of Etaples, had begun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
between the two great doctors of the age, and at every entertainment
the guests would take part with Erasmus against
Lefevre, and Lefevre against Erasmus.<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> Farel hesitated
not to take his master's side. But what had especially
annoyed him was the cowardice of the philosopher of
Rotterdam with regard to the evangelical Christians. Erasmus
shut his door against them. Good! Farel will not
go and beg for admission. This was a trifling sacrifice to
him, as he felt that Erasmus possessed not that piety of
heart which is the foundation of all true theology. "Frobenius's
wife knows more of theology than he does," said
Farel; and indignant at the conduct of Erasmus, who had
written advising the pope how to set about extinguishing
the Lutheran conflagration, he boldly affirmed that Erasmus
desired to stifle the Gospel.<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">VEXATION AND ANGER OF ERASMUS.</div>

<p>This independence in young Farel exasperated the illustrious
scholar. Princes, kings, doctors, bishops, popes, reformers,
priests, men of the world&mdash;all were ready to pay him their
tribute of admiration; even Luther had treated him with a
certain forbearance; and this Dauphinese, unknown to fame
and an exile, dared brave his power. Such insolent freedom
caused Erasmus more annoyance than the homage of the
whole world could give him pleasure; and accordingly he
neglected no opportunity of venting his ill humour on Farel;
besides, by attacking so notorious a heretic, he was clearing
himself in the eyes of the Romanists from all suspicion
of heresy. "I have never met with any thing more false,
more violent, and more seditious than this man,"<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> said he;
"his heart is full of vanity, his tongue overflowing with
malice."<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> But the anger of Erasmus was not confined to
Farel; it was directed against all the French refugees in
Basle, whose frankness and decision offended him. They
had little respect to persons; and if the truth was not
openly professed, they cared not for the man, however exalted
might be his genius. They were possibly wanting in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
some measure in the suavity of the Gospel; but their
fidelity reminds us of the vigour of the ancient prophets;
and it is gratifying to meet with men who do
not bow down before what the world adores. Erasmus,
amazed at this lofty disdain, complained of it to every one.
"What!" wrote he to Melancthon, "shall we reject pontiffs
and bishops, to have more cruel, scurvy, and furious tyrants
in their place;......for such it is that France has sent us."<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a>&mdash;"Some
Frenchmen," wrote he to the pope's secretary, in a
letter accompanying his book on <i>Free Will</i>, "are still more
out of their wits than even the Germans. They have five expressions
always in their mouths: <i>Gospel</i>, <i>Word of God</i>, <i>Faith</i>,
<i>Christ</i>, <i>Holy Ghost</i>; and yet I doubt whether they be not urged
on by the spirit of Satan."<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> Instead of Farellus he would
often write <i>Fallicus</i>, thus designating one of the frankest men
of his day with the epithets of cheat and deceiver.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SAINTS&mdash;FAREL ASKS FOR DISCUSSION.</div>

<p>The vexation and anger of Erasmus were at their height,
when it was reported to him that Farel had called him a
<i>Balaam</i>. Farel believed that Erasmus, like this prophet,
allowed himself (perhaps unconsciously) to be swayed by
presents to curse the people of God. The learned Dutchman,
unable longer to contain himself, resolved to chastise the
impudent Dauphinese; and one day, as Farel was talking
with several friends on the doctrines of Christianity in the
presence of Erasmus, the latter, rudely interrupting him,
said: "Why do you call me Balaam?"<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> Farel, at first
astonished by so abrupt a question, soon recovered himself
and answered, that it was not he who had given him that
title. On being pressed to name the offender, he said it
was Du Blet of Lyons, a refugee at Basle like himself.<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a>
"It may be he who made use of the word," replied Erasmus,
"but it was you who taught him." And then, ashamed of
having lost his temper, he quickly turned the conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
to another subject. "Why," said he to Farel, "do you
assert that we ought not to invoke the saints? Is it
because it is not enjoined in Holy Scripture?"&mdash;"Yes!"
replied the Frenchman.&mdash;"Well then!" resumed Erasmus,
"I call upon you to prove by Scripture that we ought to
invoke the Holy Ghost." Farel made this simple and true
reply: "If He is God, we must invoke Him."<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a>&mdash;"I dropt
the conversation," says Erasmus, "for night was coming on."<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a>
From that hour, whenever the name of Farel fell from his pen,
he represented him as a hateful person, who ought by all
means to be shunned. The reformer's letters, on the contrary,
are full of moderation as regards Erasmus. The Gospel is
milder than philosophy, even in the most fiery temper.</p>

<p>The evangelical doctrine already counted many friends in
Basle, both in the council and among the people; but the
doctors of the university opposed it to the utmost of their
power. &OElig;colampadius, and Stör pastor of Liestal, had
maintained some theses against them. Farel thought it his
duty also to profess in Switzerland the great principle of the
evangelical school of Paris and of Meaux: <i>The Word of God
is all-sufficient</i>. He requested permission of the university
to maintain certain theses, "the rather to be reproved,"
added he, "if I am in error, than to teach others;"<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> but the
university refused.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THESES&mdash;SCRIPTURE AND FAITH.</div>

<p>Upon this Farel addressed the council; and the council
issued a public notice that a Christian man, named William
Farel, having by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost drawn
up certain articles in conformity with the Gospel,<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> they had
given him leave to maintain them in Latin. The university
forbade all priests and students to be present at the disputation;
but the council sent out a proclamation to the
contrary effect.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>The following are some of the thirteen propositions put
forth by Farel:</p>

<p>"Christ has given us the most perfect rule of life: no one
has the right to take anything from it, or to add anything
thereto.</p>

<p>"To live according to any other precepts than those of
Christ, leads directly to impiety.</p>

<p>"The real ministry of priests is to attend to the ministering
of the Word; and for them there is no higher dignity.</p>

<p>"To deprive the glad-tidings of Christ of their certainty,
is to destroy them.</p>

<p>"He who hopes to be justified by his own power, and by
his own merits, and not by faith, sets himself up as God.</p>

<p>"Jesus Christ, whom all things obey, is our polestar, and
the only star that we ought to follow."<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a></p>

<p>Thus did this "Frenchman" stand up in Basle.<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> It was
a child of the mountains of Dauphiny, brought up in Paris
at the feet of Lefevre, who thus boldly set forth in that
illustrious university of Switzerland, and in the presence of
Erasmus, the great principles of the Reformation. Two
leading ideas pervaded Farel's theses: one, that of a return
to Holy Scripture; the other, of a return to faith: two
things which the Papacy at the beginning of the 18th century
distinctly condemned as impious and heretical in the
famous constitution <i>Unigenitus</i>, and which, closely connected
with each other, do in fact subvert the whole of the papal
system. If faith in Christ is the beginning and end of
Christianity, it follows that we must cleave to the Word of
Christ, and not to the voice of the Church. Nay more: if
faith in Christ unites souls, where is the necessity of an
external bond? Is it with croziers, bulls, and tiaras, that
their holy unity is formed? Faith joins in spiritual and true
unity all those in whose hearts it takes up its abode. Thus
vanished at a single blow the triple delusion of meritorious
works, human traditions, and false unity; and this is the
sum of Roman-catholicism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DISPUTATION&mdash;MEEKNESS AND IMPETUOSITY.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>The disputation began in Latin.<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> Farel and &OElig;colampadius
set forth and proved their articles, calling repeatedly
on their adversaries to reply; but not one of them appeared.
These sophists, as &OElig;colampadius terms them, acted the
braggart,&mdash;but in dark holes and corners.<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a> The people,
therefore, began to despise the cowardice of the priests, and
to detest their tyranny.<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a></p>

<p>Thus Farel took his stand among the defenders of the
Reformation. They were greatly delighted to see a Frenchman
combine so much learning and piety, and already began
to anticipate the noblest triumphs. "He is strong enough,"
said they, "to destroy the whole Sorbonne single-handed."<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a>
His candour, sincerity, and frankness captivated every heart.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a>
But amidst all his activity, he did not forget that every
mission should begin with our own souls. The gentle
&OElig;colampadius made a compact with the ardent Farel, by
which they mutually engaged to practise humility and meekness
in their familiar conversations. These bold men, even
on the field of battle, were fitting themselves for the duties
of peace. It should be observed, however, that the impetuosity
of a Luther and a Farel were necessary virtues.
Some effort is required when the world is to be moved and the
Church renovated. In our days we are too apt to forget this
truth, which the meekest men then acknowledged. "There
are certain men," wrote &OElig;colampadius to Luther when introducing
Farel to him, "who would have his zeal against the
enemies of the truth more moderate; but I cannot help seeing
in this same zeal an admirable virtue, which, if seasonably
exerted, is no less needed than gentleness itself."<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> Posterity
has ratified the judgment of &OElig;colampadius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAREL AT STRASBURG.</div>

<p>In the month of May 1524, Farel, with some friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
from Lyons, visited Schaffhausen, Zurich, and Constance.
Zwingle and Myconius gladly welcomed this exile from
France, and Farel remembered their kindness all his life.
But on his return to Basle he found Erasmus and his other
enemies at work, and received orders to quit the city. In
vain did his friends loudly give utterance to their displeasure
at such an abuse of authority; he was compelled to quit the
territory of Switzerland, already, at this early period, the
asylum and refuge of the persecuted. "It is thus we exercise
hospitality," said the indignant &OElig;colampadius, "we
true children of Sodom!"<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a></p>

<p>At Basle, Farel had contracted a close friendship with the
Chevalier Esch, who resolved to bear him company, and they
set out with letters for Luther and Capito from &OElig;colampadius,
to whom the doctor of Basle commended Farel as "that
William who had toiled so much in the work of God."<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> At
Strasburg, Farel formed an intimacy with Capito, Bucer,
and Hedio; but it does not appear that he went so far as
Wittemberg.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">New Campaign&mdash;Farel's Call to the Ministry&mdash;An Outpost&mdash;Lyons&mdash;Sebville
at Grenoble&mdash;Conventicles&mdash;Preaching at Lyons&mdash;Maigret in
Prison&mdash;Margaret intimidated.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">NEW CAMPAIGN&mdash;FAREL CALLED.</div>

<p>God usually withdraws his servants from the field of battle,
only to bring them back stronger and better armed. Farel
and his friends of Meaux, Metz, Lyons, and Dauphiny,
driven from France by persecution, had been retempered in
Switzerland and Germany among the elder reformers; and
now, like an army at first dispersed by the enemy, but immediately
rallied, they were turning round and marching
forward in the name of the Lord. It was not only on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
frontiers that these friends of the Gospel were assembling; in
France also they were regaining courage, and preparing to
renew the attack. The bugles were already sounding the
reveillé; the soldiers were girding on their arms, and gathering
together to multiply their attacks; their leaders were
planning the order of battle; the signal, "Jesus, his Word,
and his grace," more potent in the hour of battle than the
sound of warlike music, filled all hearts with the same enthusiasm;
and everything was preparing in France for a
second campaign, to be signalized by new victories, and
new and greater reverses.</p>

<p>Montbeliard was then calling for a labourer in the Gospel.
The youthful Duke Ulrich of Wurtemberg, a violent and cruel
prince, having been dispossessed of his states by the Swabian
league in 1519, had taken refuge in this earldom, his only
remaining possession. In Switzerland he became acquainted
with the reformers; his misfortunes had proved salutary to
him; and he took delight in the Gospel.<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> &OElig;colampadius
intimated to Farel that a door was opened at Montbeliard,
and the latter secretly repaired to Basle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MINISTRY&mdash;THE GOSPEL AND NOT THE FATHERS.</div>

<p>Farel had not regularly entered on the ministry of the
Word; but we find in him, at this period of his life, all that
is necessary to constitute a minister of the Lord. He did
not lightly and of his own prompting enter the service of the
Church. "Considering my weakness," said he, "I should
not have dared preach, waiting for the Lord to send more
suitable persons."<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> But God at this time addressed him in
a threefold call. As soon as he had reached Basle, &OElig;colampadius,
touched with the wants of France, entreated him to
devote himself to it. "Behold," said he, "how little is
Jesus Christ known to all those who speak the French language.
Will you not give them some instruction in their
own tongue, that they may better understand the Scriptures?"<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a>
At the same time, the people of Montbeliard invited him
among them, and the prince gave his consent to this call.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>
Was not this a triple call from God?......"I did not think,"
said he, "that it was lawful for me to resist. I obeyed in
God's name."<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> Concealed in the house of &OElig;colampadius,
struggling against the responsibility offered to him, and yet
obliged to submit to so clear a manifestation of the will of God,
Farel accepted this charge, and &OElig;colampadius set him apart,
calling upon the name of the Lord,<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> and addressing his
friend in language full of wisdom. "The more you are inclined
to violence," said he, "the more should you practise
gentleness; temper your lion's courage with the meekness
of the dove."<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> Farel responded to this appeal with all his
soul.</p>

<p>Thus Farel, once the zealous follower of the old Church,
was about to become a servant of God in the new. If Rome
imperatively requires in a valid ordination the imposition of
the hands of a bishop who descends from the apostles in uninterrupted
succession, it is because she places human traditions
above the Word of God. In every church where the
authority of the Word is not absolute, some other authority
must needs be sought. And then, what is more natural than
to ask of the most venerated of God's ministers, that which
they cannot find in God himself? If we do not speak in the
name of Jesus Christ, is it not something at least to speak
in the name of Saint John or of Saint Paul? He who
speaks in the name of antiquity is stronger than the rationalist
who speaks only in his own name. But the christian
minister has a still higher authority: he preaches, not because
he descends from St. Chrysostom or St. Peter, but
because the Word that he proclaims comes down from God
himself. The idea of succession,<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a> venerable as it may appear,
is not the less a human system, substituted for the system
of God. In Farel's ordination there was no human succession.
Nay more: we do not see in it that which is necessary
in the Lord's fold, where every thing should be done
<i>decently and in order</i>, and whose God <i>is not a God of confusion</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
He was not regularly ordained by the Church: but
extraordinary times justify extraordinary measures. At this
memorable epoch God himself interposed. He consecrated
by marvellous dispensations those whom he called to the
regeneration of the world. In Farel's ordination we see
the infallible Word of God, given to a man of God, that he
might bear it to the world,&mdash;the call of God and of the
people,&mdash;the consecration of the heart, and a solemn appointment
by one of the ministers of the Church; and all this
was the best substitute of which his case admitted for the
full and formal seal of the Church on his ministry. Farel
took his departure for Montbeliard in company with Esch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN ADVANCED POST.</div>

<p>Farel thus found himself stationed as it were at an advanced
post. Behind him, Basle and Strasburg supported
him with their advice and their printing-presses; before him
lay the provinces of Franche Comté, Burgundy, Lorraine,
the Lyonnais, and the rest of France, where men of God were
beginning to struggle against error in the midst of profound
darkness. He immediately began to preach Jesus Christ,
and to exhort the faithful not to permit themselves to be
turned aside from the Holy Scriptures either by threats or
stratagems. Beginning, long before Calvin, the work that
this reformer was to accomplish on a much larger scale,
Farel was at Montbeliard, like a general on a hill whose
piercing eye glances over the field of battle, cheering those
who are actively engaged with the enemy, rallying those
ranks which the impetuosity of the charge has broken, and
animating by his courage those who hang back.<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> Erasmus
immediately wrote to his Roman-catholic friends, that a
Frenchman, escaped from France, was making a great disturbance
in these regions.<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PROGRESS OF THE GOSPEL&mdash;LYONS.</div>

<p>Farel's labours were not unfruitful. "On every side,"
wrote he to a fellow-countryman, "men are springing up
who devote all their powers and their lives to extend Christ's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
kingdom as widely as possible."<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> The friends of the Gospel
gave thanks to God that his blessed Word shone brighter
every day in all parts of France.<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a> The adversaries were
astounded. "The <i>faction</i>," wrote Erasmus to the Bishop of
Rochester, "is spreading daily, and is penetrating Savoy,
Lorraine, and France."<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a></p>

<p>For some time Lyons appeared to be the centre of evangelical
action within the kingdom, as Basle was without.
Francis I., marching towards the south on an expedition
against Charles V., had arrived in this city with his mother,
his sister, and the court. Margaret brought with her many
gentlemen devoted to the Gospel. "All other people she
had removed from about her person," says a letter written at
this time.<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> While Francis I. was hurrying through Lyons
an army composed of 14,000 Swiss, 6000 French, and
1500 lances of the nobility, to repel the invasion of the
imperialists into Provence; while this great city re-echoed
with the noise of arms, the tramp of horses, and the sound
of the trumpet, the friends of the Gospel were marching to
more peaceful conquests. They desired to attempt in Lyons
what they had been unable to do in Paris. Perhaps, at a
distance from the Sorbonne and from the parliament, the
Word of God might have freer course? Perhaps the second
city in the kingdom was destined to become the first for the
Gospel. Was it not there that about four centuries previously
the excellent Peter Waldo had begun to proclaim the Divine
Word? Even then he had shaken all France. And now that
God had prepared everything for the emancipation of his
Church, might there not be hopes of more extended and more
decisive success? Thus the people of Lyons, who were not
generally, indeed, "poor men," as in the twelfth century, were
beginning more courageously to handle "the sword of the
Spirit, which is the Word of God."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARANDE, PAPILLON, VAUGRIS, DU BLET.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>Among those who surrounded Margaret was her almoner,
Michael d'Arande. The duchess caused the Gospel to be
publicly preached at Lyons; and Master Michael proclaimed
the Word of God with courage and purity before a great
number of hearers, attracted partly by the charm that attends
the glad tidings wherever they are published, and partly
also by the favour in which the preaching and the preacher
were held by the king's beloved sister.<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a></p>

<p>Anthony Papillon, a man of highly cultivated mind, an
elegant Latin scholar, a friend of Erasmus, "the first in
France for knowledge of the Gospel,"<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> accompanied the
princess also. At Margaret's request he had translated Luther's
work on monastic vows, "in consequence of which he
had much ado with those Parisian vermin," says Sebville;<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a>
but Margaret had protected him against the attacks of the
Sorbonne, and procured him the appointment of headmaster
of requests to the dauphin, with a seat in the Great
Council.<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> He was not less useful to the Gospel by his devotedness
than by his prudence. A merchant, named Vaugris,
and especially a gentleman named Anthony du Blet, a
friend of Farel's, took the lead in the Reformation at Lyons.
The latter person, a man of great activity, served as a bond of
union between the Christians scattered throughout those
countries, and placed them in communication with Basle.
While the armed hosts of Francis I. had merely passed
through Lyons, the spiritual soldiers of Jesus Christ halted
there with Margaret; and leaving the former to carry the war
into Provence and the plains of Italy, they began the fight
of the Gospel in Lyons itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SAONE AND MACON&mdash;SEBVILLE AT GRENOBLE.</div>

<p>But they did not confine their efforts to the city. They
looked all around them; the campaign was opened on several
points at the same time; and the Christians of Lyons
encouraged by their exertions and their labours all those
who confessed Christ in the surrounding provinces. They
did more: they went and proclaimed it in places where it
was as yet unknown. The new doctrine ascended the Saone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
and an evangelist passed through the narrow and irregular
streets of Macon. Michael d'Arande himself visited that
place in 1524, and, aided by Margaret's name, obtained permission
to preach in this city,<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> which was destined at a later
period to be filled with blood, and become for ever memorable
for its <i>sauteries</i>.<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a></p>

<p>After exploring the districts of the Saone, the Christians
of Lyons, ever on the watch, extended their incursions in the
direction of the Alps. There was at Lyons a Dominican
named Maigret, who had been compelled to quit Dauphiny,
where he had boldly preached the new doctrine, and who
earnestly requested that some one would go and encourage
his brethren of Grenoble and Gap. Papillon and Du Blet
repaired thither.<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> A violent storm had just broken out
there against Sebville and his preachings. The Dominicans
had moved heaven and earth; and maddened at seeing so
many evangelists escape them (as Farel, Anemond, and

within their reach.<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> They therefore called for Sebville's

<div class="sidenote">FONDNESS FOR SYMBOLS&mdash;CONVENTICLES.</div>

<p>The friends of the Gospel in Grenoble were alarmed; must
Sebville also be taken from them!......Margaret interceded

friends to the Gospel, exerted themselves in behalf of the
evangelical grayfriar, and at length their united efforts rescued
him from the fury of his adversaries.<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a></p>

<p>But if Sebville's life was saved, his mouth was stopped.
"Remain silent," said they, "or you will be led to the scaffold."&mdash;"Silence
has been imposed on me," he wrote to
Anemond de Coct, "under pain of death."<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> These threats
alarmed even those of whom the most favourable hopes had
been entertained. The king's advocate and other friends of
the Gospel now showed nothing but coldness.<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> Many returned
to the Romish worship, pretending to adore God
secretly in their hearts, and to give a spiritual signification
to the outward observances of Romanism. A melancholy
delusion, leading from infidelity to infidelity. There is no
hypocrisy that cannot be justified in the same manner. The
unbeliever, by means of his systems of myths and allegories,
will preach Christ from the christian pulpit; and a philosopher
will be able, by a little ingenuity, to find in an abominable
superstition among the pagans, the type of a pure and
elevated idea. In religion the first thing is truth. Some of
the Grenoble Christians, among whom were Amadeus Galbert,
and a cousin of Anemond's, still clung fast to their faith.<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a>
These pious men would meet secretly with Sebville at each
other's houses, and <i>talk</i> together about the Gospel. They
repaired to some secluded spot; they visited some brother
by night; or met in secret to pray to Christ, as thieves
lurking for a guilty purpose. Often would a false alarm
disturb the humble assembly. The adversaries consented to
wink at these secret conventicles; but they had sworn that
the stake should be the lot of any one who ventured to speak
of the Word of God in public.<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PREACHING AT LYONS&mdash;MAIGRET IMPRISONED.</div>

<p>Such was the state of affairs when Du Blet and Papillon
arrived at Grenoble. Finding that Sebville had been silenced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
they exhorted him to go and preach the Gospel at Lyons.
The Lent of the following year would present a favourable
opportunity for proclaiming the Gospel to a numerous
crowd. Michael d'Arande, Maigret, and Sebville, proposed
to fight at the head of the Gospel army. Everything was
thus preparing for a striking manifestation of evangelical
truth in the second city of France. The rumour of this
evangelical Lent extended as far as Switzerland. "Sebville
is free, and will preach the Lent sermons at Saint Paul's in
Lyons," wrote Anemond to Farel.<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> But a great disaster,
which threw all France into confusion, intervened and prevented
this spiritual combat. It is during peace that the
conquests of the Gospel are achieved. The defeat of Pavia,
which took place in the month of February, disconcerted the
daring project of the reformers.</p>

<p>Meantime, without waiting for Sebville, Maigret had begun
early in the winter to preach salvation by Jesus Christ
alone, in despite of the strenuous opposition of the priests
and monks of Lyons.<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> In these sermons there was not
a word of the worship of the creature, of saints, of the
virgin, of the power of the priesthood. The great mystery
of godliness, "God manifest in the flesh," was alone proclaimed.
The old heresies of the poor men of Lyons are reappearing,
it was said, and in a more dangerous form than
ever! But notwithstanding this opposition, Maigret continued
his ministry; the faith that animated his soul found
utterance in words of power: it is in the nature of truth to
embolden the hearts of those who have received it. Yet
Rome was destined to prevail at Lyons as at Grenoble.
Maigret was arrested, notwithstanding Margaret's protection,
dragged through the streets, and cast into prison. The merchant
Vaugris, who then quitted the city on his road to Switzerland,
spread the news everywhere on his passage. All
were astonished and depressed. One thought, however,
gave confidence to the friends of the Reformation: "Maigret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
is taken," said they, "but <i>Madame d'Alençon is there;
praised be God</i>!"<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MARGARET INTIMIDATED.</div>

<p>It was not long before they were compelled to renounce
even this hope. The Sorbonne had condemned several of this
faithful minister's propositions.<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> Margaret, whose position
became daily more difficult, found the boldness of the partisans
of the Reformation and the hatred of the powerful increasing
side by side. Francis I. began to grow impatient at the
zeal of these evangelists: he looked upon them as mere
fanatics whom it was good policy to repress. Margaret,
thus fluctuating between desire to serve her brethren and
her inability to protect them, sent them word to avoid
running into fresh dangers, as she could no longer intercede
with the king in their favour. The friends of the Gospel
believed that this determination was not irrevocable. "God
has given her grace," said they, "to say and write only
what is necessary to poor souls."<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> But if this human support
is taken away, Christ still remains. It is well that the
soul should be stripped of all other protection, that it may
rely upon God alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FRENCH AT BASLE&mdash;ENCOURAGED BY THE SWISS.</div>

<p>The exertions of the friends of the Gospel in France were
paralyzed. The men in power were beginning to show their
hostility to Christianity; Margaret was growing alarmed; terrible
news would soon be coming across the Alps and plunging
the nation into mourning, filling it with one thought only&mdash;of
saving the king, of saving France. But if the Christians of
Lyons were checked in their labours, were there not soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
at Basle who had escaped from the battle and who were ready
to begin the fight again. The exiles from France have
never forgotten her. Driven from their country for nearly
three centuries by the fanaticism of Rome, their latest descendants
have been seen carrying to the cities and fields of
their ancestors those treasures of which the pope still deprives
them.<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> At the very moment when the soldiers of Christ in
France were mournfully laying down their arms, the refugees
at Basle were preparing for the combat. As they saw the
monarchy of Saint Louis and of Charlemagne falling from
the hands of Francis I., shall they not feel urged to lay hold
of <i>a kingdom which cannot be moved</i>.<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a></p>

<p>Farel, Anemond, Esch, Toussaint, and their friends formed
an evangelical society in Switzerland with the view of rescuing
their country from its spiritual darkness. Intelligence
reached them from every quarter, that there was an increasing
thirst for God's Word in France;<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> it was desirable to
take advantage of this, and to water and sow while it was
yet seedtime. &OElig;colampadius, Zwingle, and Oswald Myconius,
were continually exhorting them to do this, giving
the right hand of fellowship, and communicating to them a
portion of their own faith. In January 1525, the Swiss
schoolmaster wrote to the French chevalier: "Banished as
you are from your country by the tyranny of Antichrist,
even your presence among us proves that you have acted
boldly in the cause of the Gospel. The tyranny of christian
bishops will at length induce the people to look upon them
as deceivers. Stand firm; the time is not far distant when
we shall enter the haven of repose, whether we be struck
down by our tyrants, or they themselves be struck down;<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a>
all then will be well for us, provided we have been faithful to
Christ Jesus."</p>

<div class="sidenote">FEARS AND DIVISIONS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>These encouragements were of great value to the French
refugees; but a blow inflicted by these very Christians of
Switzerland and Germany, who sought to cheer them, cruelly
wrung their hearts. Recently escaped from the scaffold or
the burning pile, they saw with dismay the evangelical
Christians on the other side of the Rhine disturbing the
repose they enjoyed by their lamentable differences. The
discussions on the Lord's Supper had begun. Deeply
moved and agitated, feeling strongly the necessity of brotherly
unity, the French would have made every sacrifice to conciliate
these divided sentiments. This became their leading
idea. At the epoch of the Reformation, none had greater
need than they of christian unity; of this Calvin was afterwards
a proof. "Would to God that I might purchase
peace, concord, and union in Jesus Christ at the cost of my
life, which in truth is of little worth," said Peter Toussaint.<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a>
The French, whose discernment was correct and prompt,
saw immediately that these rising dissensions would check
the work of the Reformation. "All things would go on
more prosperously than many persons imagine, if we were
but agreed among ourselves. Numbers would gladly come to
the light; but when they see these divisions among the
learned, they stand hesitating and confused."<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a></p>

<p>The French were the first to suggest conciliatory advances.
"Why," wrote they from Strasburg, "is not Bucer or some
other learned man sent to Luther? The longer we wait
the greater will these dissensions become." Their fears
grew stronger every day.<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> At length, finding all their
exertions of no avail, these Christians mournfully turned
their eyes away from Germany, and fixed them solely upon
France.</p>

<p>France&mdash;the conversion of France, thenceforth exclusively
occupied the hearts of these generous men whom history,
that has inscribed on her pages the names of so many
individuals vainly puffed up with their own glory, has for
three centuries passed over in silence. Thrown on a foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
land, they fell on their knees, and daily, in silence and
obscurity, invoked God in behalf of the country of their
forefathers.<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> Prayer was the power by which the Gospel
spread through the kingdom, and the great instrument by
which the conquests of the Reformation were gained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRANSLATION AND PRINTING AT BASLE.</div>

<p>But these Frenchmen were not merely men of prayer:
never has the evangelical army contained combatants more
ready to sacrifice their lives in the day of battle. They felt
the importance of scattering the Holy Scriptures and pious
books in their country, still overshadowed with the gloom of
superstition. A spirit of inquiry was breathing over the
whole kingdom: it seemed necessary on all sides to spread
the sails to the wind. Anemond, ever prompt in action,
and Michael Bentin, a refugee like himself, resolved to unite
their zeal, their talents, their resources, and their labours.
Bentin wished to establish a printing press at Basle, and the
chevalier, to profit by the little German he knew, to translate
the best works of the Reformers into French. "Oh," said
they, rejoicing in their plans, "would to God that France
were filled with evangelical volumes, so that everywhere, in
the cottages of the poor, in the palaces of the nobles, in
cloisters and presbyteries, nay, in the inmost sanctuary of
the heart, a powerful testimony might be borne to the grace
of Jesus Christ!"<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TRACTS DISTRIBUTED IN FRANCE.</div>

<p>Funds were necessary for such an undertaking, and the
refugees had nothing. Vaugris was then at Basle; on his
departure Anemond gave him a letter for the brethren of
Lyons, many of whom abounded in the riches of this world,
and who, although oppressed, were faithful to the Gospel;
he requested them to send him some assistance;<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> but that
did not suffice; the French wished to establish several
presses at Basle, that should be worked night and day, so as
to inundate France with the Word of God.<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> At Meaux, at
Metz, and in other places, were men rich and powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
enough to support this enterprise. No one could address
Frenchmen with so much authority as Farel himself, and
it was to him that Anemond applied.<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a></p>

<p>It does not appear that the chevalier's project was realized,
but the work was done by others. The presses of
Basle were constantly occupied in printing French works;
they were forwarded to Farel, and by him introduced into
France with unceasing activity. One of the first writings
sent by this Religious Tract Society was Luther's <i>Explanation
of the Lord's Prayer</i>. "We are retailing the Pater
at four deniers of Basle each," wrote Vaugris to Farel, "but
we sell them wholesale at the rate of two florins the two
hundred, which comes to something less."<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a></p>

<p>Anemond sent to Farel from Basle all the useful books
that appeared or that arrived from Germany; at one time
a work on the appointment of Gospel ministers, at another
a treatise on the education of children.<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> Farel examined
these works; he composed, translated or got others to translate
them into French, and seemed at one and the same time
entirely devoted to active exertions and to the labours of
the study. Anemond urged on and superintended the printing;
and these epistles, prayers, books, and broadsheets,
were the means of the regeneration of the age. While profligacy
descended from the throne, and darkness from the
steps of the altar, these unnoticed writings alone diffused
throughout the nation beams of light and seeds of holiness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NEW TESTAMENT&mdash;COLPORTAGE.</div>

<p>But it was especially God's Word that the evangelical
merchant of Lyons was calling for in the name of his fellow-countrymen.
These people of the sixteenth century, so
hungering for intellectual food, were to receive in their own
tongue those ancient monuments of the first ages of the
world, in which the new breath of primitive humanity respires,
and those holy oracles of the Gospel times in which
shines forth the fulness of the revelation of Christ. Vaugris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
wrote to Farel: "I beseech you, if possible, to have the
New Testament translated by some person who can do it
efficiently: it would be a great blessing for France, Burgundy,
and Savoy. And if you want proper type, I will
have some brought from Paris or Lyons; but if there be
any good types at Basle, it will be all the better."</p>

<p>Lefevre had already published at Meaux, but in detached
portions, the books of the New Testament in French. Vaugris
wished for some one to revise it thoroughly, and to
superintend a complete edition. Lefevre undertook to do so,
and he published it, as we have already seen, on the 12th of
October 1524. An uncle of Vaugris, named Conrard, also a
refugee at Basle, immediately procured a copy. The Chevalier
Coct happening to be at a friend's house on the 18th
of November, there saw the book, and was filled with joy.
"Lose no time in reprinting it," said he, "for I doubt not a
great number will be called for."<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a></p>

<p>Thus was the Word of God offered to France in opposition
to the traditions of the Church, which Rome still continues
to present to her. "How can we distinguish what is
of man in your traditions, and what is of God," said the
reformers, "except by the Scriptures of God? The maxims
of the Fathers, the decretals of the pontiffs, cannot be the
rule of our faith. They show us what was the opinion of
these old doctors; but the Word alone teaches us what is
the judgment of God. We must submit everything to the
rule of Scripture."</p>

<p>Such were the principal means by which these writings
were circulated. Farel and his friends consigned the books
to certain pedlars or <i>colporteurs</i>, simple and pious men, who,
laden with their precious burden, passed from town to town,
from village to village, and from house to house, in Franche
Comté, Lorraine, Burgundy, and the adjoining provinces,
knocking at every door. They procured the books at a low
rate, "that they might be the more eager to sell them."<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a>
Thus as early as 1524 there existed in Basle a Bible society,
a tract society, and an association of colporteurs, for the
benefit of France. It is a mistake to conceive that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
efforts date only from our own age; they go back in essentials
not only to the times of the Reformation, but still
farther to the primitive ages of the Church.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<blockquote><p class="hanging">Progress at Montbeliard&mdash;Resistance and Commotion&mdash;Toussaint leaves
&OElig;colampadius&mdash;The Image of Saint Anthony&mdash;Death of Anemond&mdash;Strasburg&mdash;Lambert's
Letter to Francis I.&mdash;Successive Defeats.</p></blockquote>


<div class="sidenote">PROGRESS AT MONTBELIARD.</div>

<p>The attention which Farel bestowed on France did not
divert his attention from the place where he was residing.
Arriving at Montbeliard about the end of July 1524, he
had hardly sown the seed, before the first fruits of the
harvest (to use the words of &OElig;colampadius) began to appear.
Farel wrote to his friend with great exultation. "It
is an easy thing," replied the doctor of Basle, "to instil a
few dogmas into the ears of our auditors; but to change
their hearts is in the power of God alone."<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a></p>

<p>The Chevalier de Coct, delighted with this intelligence,
ran with his usual vivacity to Peter Toussaint. "I shall
set off to-morrow to visit Farel," said he hastily. Toussaint,
more calm, was writing to the evangelist of Montbeliard:
"Be careful," said he to Farel; "you are engaged in an
important cause; it must not be polluted by the counsels of
men. The mighty ones promise you their favour, their
support, and heaps of gold......But to put your trust in
these things, is deserting Christ and walking in darkness."<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a>
Toussaint was finishing this letter when the chevalier
entered; the latter took it, and departed for Montbeliard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESISTANCE&mdash;EXHORTATION TO MILDNESS.</div>

<p>He found the city in great commotion. Many of the
nobles were alarmed, and said as they looked contemptuously
at Farel: "What does this sorry fellow want with
us? Would to God he had never come! He cannot stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
here, for he will ruin us all, as well as himself." The lords
who had taken refuge with the duke at Montbeliard, feared
that the disturbance, which everywhere accompanied the
Reformation, would attract the attention of Ferdinand and
Charles V., and that they would be expelled from their last
asylum. But it was the clergy in particular who resisted
Farel. The superior of the Franciscans of Besançon had
hastened to Montbeliard, and formed a plan of defence in
conjunction with the clergy of the place. On the following
Sunday, Farel had hardly begun to preach, before they
interrupted him, calling him liar and heretic. In an instant
the whole assembly was in an uproar. The audience rose
up, and called for silence. The duke hurried to the spot,
seized both Farel and the superior, and ordered the latter
either to prove or to retract his charges. The Franciscan
adopted the last alternative, and an official account of the
whole affair was published.<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a></p>

<p>This attack excited Farel all the more; he thought it was
now his duty to unmask without scruple those interested
priests; and drawing the sword of the Word, he plied it
vigorously. He was more inclined to imitate Jesus when
he expelled the money-changers from the temple and overthrew
their tables, than when the spirit of prophecy declared
of him: <i>He shall neither strive nor cry, neither shall any
man hear his voice in the streets</i>. &OElig;colampadius was
affrighted. These two men were perfect types of two characters
diametrically opposed to each other, and yet both
worthy of admiration. "You were sent," wrote &OElig;colampadius
to Farel, "to draw men gently to the truth, and not
to drag them with violence; to spread the Gospel, and not to
curse them. Physicians resort to amputation only when
other means have failed. Act the part of a physician, and
not of an executioner. It is not enough, in my opinion, to
be gentle towards the friends of the Gospel; you must likewise
gain over the adversaries. If the wolves are driven
from the sheepfold, let the sheep at least hear the voice of
the shepherd. Pour oil and wine into the wounds, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
conduct yourself as an evangelist, not as a judge or a
tyrant."<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CONSPIRACY AGAINST TOUSSAINT.</div>

<p>The report of these labours spread into France and Lorraine,
and the Sorbonne and the Cardinal Guise were beginning
to be alarmed at this meeting of refugees at Basle and
Montbeliard. They would willingly have broken up a troublesome
alliance; for error knows no greater triumph than
when attracting some deserter to its standard. Already had
Martial Mazurier and others given the papal party in France
an opportunity of rejoicing over shameful defections; but if
they could succeed in seducing one of these confessors of
Christ, who had taken refuge on the banks of the Rhine, and
who had suffered so much for the name of the Lord, how
great would be the victory for the Roman hierarchy! They
therefore planted their batteries, and the youngest of these
refugees was the object of their attack.</p>

<p>The dean, the Cardinal of Lorraine, and all those who
joined the crowded meetings held in this prelate's mansion,
deplored the sad fate of Peter Toussaint, who had once promised
so fair. He is at Basle, said they, in the house of
&OElig;colampadius, living with one of the leaders of this heresy!
They wrote to him with fervour, and as if they would rescue
him from eternal condemnation. These letters were the
more painful to the young man, because he could not help
recognising in them the marks of sincere affection.<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> One of
his relations, probably the dean himself, urged him to remove
to Paris, to Metz, or to any other place in the world, provided
it were far away from these Lutherans. This relation, bearing
in mind all that Toussaint owed to him, doubted not that
he would immediately comply; but when he found his efforts
useless, his affection changed into violent hatred. At the
same time this resistance exasperated the whole family and
all his friends against the young refugee. They went to his
mother, who was "under the power of the monks;"<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
priests crowded round her, frightening and persuading her
that her son had committed crimes that they could not mention
without shuddering. Upon this the afflicted mother
wrote a touching letter to her son, "full of weeping" (said
he), and in which she described her misery in heart-rending

son! cursed be the breasts that suckled thee, and the
knees that bare thee!"<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HE LEAVES &OElig;COLAMPADIUS.</div>

<p>The unhappy Toussaint was distracted: What should he
do? He could not return into France. By leaving Basle
and going to Zurich or Wittemberg, beyond the reach of his
family, he would only add to their sorrow. &OElig;colampadius advised
a middle course: "Leave my house," said he.<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> With
a heart full of sadness, he adopted the suggestion, and went
to live with an ignorant and obscure priest,<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> one well adapted
to reassure his relations. What a change for Toussaint!
He never met his host save at meals, at which times they
were continually discussing matters of faith; and as soon
as the repast was over, Toussaint retired to his chamber,
where alone, far from noise and controversy, he carefully
studied the Word of God. "The Lord is my witness," said
he, "that in this valley of tears I have but one desire, that
of seeing Christ's kingdom extended, so that all with one
mouth may glorify God."<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a></p>

<p>One circumstance occurred which consoled Toussaint. The
enemies of the Gospel were daily growing stronger in Metz.
At his entreaty, the Chevalier d'Esch departed in the month
of January 1525, to encourage the evangelical Christians in
this city. He traversed the forests of the Vosges, and
reached the place where Leclerc had laid down his life,
carrying with him several books with which Farel had provided
him.<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A MESSAGE FROM DAUPHINY&mdash;IDOLATRY.</div>

<p>It was not only to Lorraine that these Frenchmen turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
their eyes. The Chevalier de Coct received letters from one
of Farel's brothers, depicting the state of Dauphiny in the
gloomiest colours. He carefully avoided showing them lest
he should alarm the weak-hearted, and was content with
ardently seeking from God the support of his almighty hands.<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a>
In December 1524, Peter Verrier, a Dauphinese messenger,
arrived on horseback at Montbeliard with commissions for
Anemond and Farel. The chevalier, with his usual vivacity,
immediately resolved on returning to France. "If Peter has
brought any money," wrote he to Farel, "keep it; if he has
brought any letters, open and copy them, and then forward
them to me. Do not, however, sell the horse, but take care
of it, for perchance I may need it. I am inclined to enter
France secretly, and go to Jacobus Faber (Lefevre) and
Arandius. Write and tell me what you think of it."<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a></p>

<p>Such was the confidence and open-heartedness that existed
between these refugees. The one opened the other's letters,
and received his money. It is true that de Coct was already
indebted thirty-six crowns to Farel, whose purse was always
open to his friends. There was more zeal than discretion in
the chevalier's desire to re-enter France. He was of too
imprudent a character not to expose himself to certain death.
This Farel no doubt explained to him. He left Basle, and
withdrew to a small town, where he had "great hopes of acquiring
the German language, God willing."<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a></p>

<p>Farel continued preaching the Gospel in Montbeliard.
His soul was vexed as he beheld the majority of the people
in this city entirely given up to the worship of images. It
was, in his opinion, a revival of the old pagan idolatry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ST. ANTHONY THROWN INTO THE RIVER.</div>

<p>Yet the exhortations of &OElig;colampadius, and the fear of
compromising the truth, would perhaps have long restrained
him, but for an unforeseen circumstance. One day about
the end of February (it was the feast of Saint Anthony)
Farel was walking on the banks of a little river that runs
through the city, beneath a lofty rock on which the citadel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
is built, when, on reaching the bridge, he met a procession,
which was crossing it, reciting prayers to St. Anthony, and
headed by two priests bearing the image of this saint. Farel
suddenly found himself face to face with these superstitions,
without, however, having sought for them. A violent
struggle took place in his soul. Shall he give way? shall
he hide himself? Would not this be a cowardly act of
unbelief? These lifeless images, borne on the shoulders of
ignorant priests, made his blood boil. Farel boldly advanced,
snatched the shrine of the holy hermit from the priest's arms,
and threw it over the bridge into the river. And then, turning
to the awe-stricken crowd, he exclaimed: "Poor idolaters,
will ye never forsake your idolatry!"<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a></p>

<p>The priests and people stood motionless with astonishment.
A religious fear seemed to rivet them to the spot.
But they soon recovered from their stupor. "The image is
drowning," exclaimed one of the crowd; and transports and
shouts of rage succeeded their death-like silence. The multitude
would have rushed on the sacrilegious wretch who had
just thrown the object of their adoration into the water.
But Farel, we know not how, escaped their violence.<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a></p>

<p>There is reason, we are aware, to regret that the reformer
should have been hurried into the commission of an act that
tended rather to check the progress of the truth. No one
should think himself authorized to attack with violence any
institution sanctioned by the public authority. There is,
however, in the zeal of the reformer something more noble
than that cold prudence so common among men, which
shrinks before the least danger, and fears to make the least
sacrifice for the advancement of God's kingdom. Farel was
not ignorant that by this proceeding he was exposing himself
to the fate of Leclerc. But his own conscience bore witness
that he desired only to promote the glory of God, and this
made him superior to all fear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANEMOND'S DEATH&mdash;STRASBURG.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>After this affair of the bridge, which is a characteristic
feature in Farel's history, the reformer was obliged to hide
himself, and he quitted the town soon after. He took refuge
at Basle with &OElig;colampadius; but ever preserved that
attachment for Montbeliard which a servant of God never
ceases to entertain for the first fruits of his ministry.<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a></p>

<p>Sad tidings awaited Farel at Basle. If he was a fugitive,
his friend Anemond de Coct was seriously ill. Farel immediately
sent him four gold crowns; but a letter written by
Oswald Myconius on the 25th of March, announced the
death of the chevalier. "Let us so live," said Oswald, "that
we may enter into that rest into which we hope the soul of
Anemond has already entered."<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a></p>

<p>Thus did Anemond descend to a premature grave; still
young, full of activity and strength, willing to undertake
every labour to evangelize France, and who was in himself
a host. <i>God's ways are not our ways.</i> Not long before, and
in the neighbourhood of Zurich, another chevalier, Ulrich
Hütten, had breathed his last. There is some similarity in
the characters of the German and French knights, but the
piety and christian virtues of the Dauphinese place him far
above the witty and intrepid enemy of the pope and of the
monks.</p>

<p>Shortly after Anemond's death, Farel, unable to remain
in Basle, whence he had been once banished, joined his friends
Capito and Bucer at Strasburg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAMBERT TO FRANCIS I.</div>

<p>Strasburg, an imperial city, at whose head was Sturm, one
of the most distinguished men in Germany, and which contained
many celebrated doctors within its walls, was as it were
an advanced post of the Reformation, thrown beyond the
Rhine, and in which the persecuted Christians of France and
Lorraine took refuge, and from whence they hoped to win
these countries to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Lambert's
pious ambition was to become for France what Luther was for
Germany, and accordingly he had no sooner reached Strasburg
after quitting Metz, than he made his preparations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
waiting for the moment when he should be enabled to carry
the sword of the Gospel into the very heart of that country
which he loved so tenderly.<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a></p>

<p>He first appealed to Francis I. "The pope," said he, "if
he had his way, would change every king into a beggar.
Lend your ear to the truth, most excellent prince, and God
will make you great among the princes of the earth. Woe be
to all the nations whose master is the pope. Oh, Avignon, city
of my birth, art thou not the wretched daughter of Babylon?
Given over to a legate, not of holiness, but of impiety and
heresy;<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> thou seest lewd sports, immodest dances, and adultery
multiply within thy walls, and all around thy fields are
laid waste by daily hunting parties, and thy poor labourers
oppressed.</p>

<p>"O most christian king, thy people thirst for the Word of
God." At the same time addressing the pope, he said, "Erelong
that powerful France which thou are wont to call
thy arm will separate from thee."<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> Such were Lambert's
illusions!</p>

<p>Finding that his epistle had produced no effect, he wrote
a second in a still more earnest tone. "What!" said he,
"the Arabians, Chaldeans, Greeks, and Jews possess the
Word of God in their own language, and the French, Germans,
Italians, and Spaniards cannot have it in theirs!
Let God but speak to the nations in the language of the
people, and the empire of pride will crumble into dust."<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SUCCESSIVE DEFEATS&mdash;PAVIA.</div>

<p>These anticipations were not realised. At Montbeliard and
Basle, as at Lyons, the ranks of the reformers had suffered.
Some of the most devoted combatants had been taken off by
death, others by persecution and exile. In vain did the
warriors of the Gospel mount everywhere to the assault;
everywhere they were beaten back. But if the forces they
had concentrated, first at Meaux, then at Lyons, and afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
at Basle, were dispersed in succession, there still remained
combatants here and there, who in Lorraine, at Meaux,
and even in Paris, struggled more or less openly to uphold
the Word of God in France. Though the Reformation saw
its columns broken, it still had its isolated champions. Against
these the Sorbonne and the parliament were about to turn
their anger. They would not have remaining on the soil of
France, a single one of these noble minded men who had undertaken
to plant in it the standard of Jesus Christ; and
unheard of misfortunes seemed now to be conspiring with
the enemies of the Reformation, and to aid them in the accomplishment
of their task.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARGARET'S ANXIETY FOR FRANCIS I.</div>

<p>During the latter period of Farel's sojourn at Montbeliard,
great events were passing on the theatre of the world.
Lannoy and Pescara, Charles's generals, having quitted
France on the approach of Francis I., this prince had crossed
the Alps, and blockaded Pavia. On the 24th of February
1525, he was attacked by Pescara. Bonnivet, La Trémouille,
Palisse, and Lescure died fighting round their sovereign.
The Duke of Alençon, Margaret's husband, the first prince
of the blood, had fled with the rear-guard, and gone to die of
shame and grief at Lyons; and Francis, thrown from his
horse, had surrendered his sword to Charles Lannoy, viceroy
of Naples, who received it kneeling. The King of
France was prisoner to the emperor. His captivity seemed
the greatest of misfortunes. "Nothing is left me but honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
and life," wrote the king to his mother. But no one felt a
keener sorrow than Margaret. The glory of her country
tarnished, France without a monarch and exposed to the
greatest dangers, her beloved brother the captive of his
haughty enemy, her husband dishonoured and dead......What
bitter thoughts were these!......But she had a comforter; and
while her brother to console himself repeated: "<i>Tout est
perdu, fors l'honneur</i>, all is lost save honour!" she was able
to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fors Jésus seul, mon frère, fils de Dieu!<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save Christ alone, dear brother, Son of God!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Margaret thought that in the hour of trial Francis
might receive the Word of God. A few months before,
the king had already betrayed religious sentiments on the
death of his daughter the Princess Charlotte. The Duchess
of Alençon, having concealed the child's sickness from him,
Francis, who no doubt suspected something, dreamed three
several times that his daughter said to him: "Farewell,
my king, I am going to paradise." He guessed that she
was dead, and gave way to "extreme grief," but wrote to
his sister that "he would rather die than desire to have her
in this world contrary to the will of God, whose name be
blessed."<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a></p>

<p>Margaret thought that the terrible disaster of Pavia would
complete what the first trial had begun; and most earnestly
desiring that the Word of God might be with Francis in his
prison, she wrote a very touching letter, which deserves to
be preserved, to Marshal Montmorency, who had been taken
prisoner along with the king. It is very probable that she
speaks of herself and Bishop Briçonnet in the graceful
allegory which serves as an introduction to her request:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Dear cousin, there is a certain very devout hermit who
for these three years past has been constantly urging a man
whom I know to pray to God for the king, which he has
done; and he is assured that if it pleases the king by way
of devotion, daily, when in his closet, to read the epistles of
St. Paul, he will be delivered to the glory of God; for He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
promises in His Gospel, that whosoever loveth the truth,
<i>the truth shall make him free</i>. And forasmuch as I think he
has them not, I send you mine, begging you to entreat him
on my part that he will read them, and I firmly believe that
the Holy Ghost, which abideth in the letter, will do by him
as great things as he has done by those who wrote them;
for God is not less powerful or good than He has been, and
his promises never deceive. He has humbled you by captivity,
but he has not forsaken you, giving you patience and
hope in his goodness, which is always accompanied by consolation
and a more perfect knowledge of Him, which I am
sure is better than the king ever knows, having his mind
less at liberty, on account of the imprisonment of the body.</p>

<p class="signature">
"Your good Cousin, <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">REACTION AGAINST THE REFORM.</div>

<p>In such language did Margaret of Valois, full of anxiety
for the salvation of her brother's soul, address the king after
the battle of Pavia. It is unfortunate that her letter and the
Epistles of St. Paul were not sent direct to Francis; she
could not have selected a worse medium than Montmorency.</p>

<p>The letters which the king wrote from the Castle of Pizzighitone,
where he was confined, afforded his sister some
little consolation. At the beginning of April she wrote to
him: "After the sorrow of the Passion this has been a Holy
Ghost (<i>i. e.</i> a Pentecost), seeing the grace that our Lord has
shown you."<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> But unhappily the prisoner did not find in
the Word of God that <i>truth which maketh free</i>, and which
Margaret so earnestly desired he might possess.</p>

<p>All France, princes, parliament, and people, was overwhelmed
with consternation. Erelong, as in the first three
ages of the Church, the calamity that had befallen the country
was imputed to the Christians; and fanatical cries were
heard on every side calling for blood, as a means of averting
still greater disasters. The moment, therefore, was favourable;
it was not enough to have dislodged the evangelical
Christians from the three strong positions they had taken;
it was necessary to take advantage of the general panic, to
strike while the iron was hot, and sweep the whole kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
clear of that opposition which had become so formidable
to the papacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ACCUSATIONS AND MENACES.</div>

<p>At the head of this conspiracy and of these clamours were
Beda, Duchesne, and Lecouturier. These irreconcilable
enemies of the Gospel flattered themselves they might easily
obtain from public terror the victims that had been hitherto
refused them. They instantly employed every device;
conversations, fanatical harangues, lamentations, threats,
defamatory writings, to excite the anger of the nation, and
particularly of their governors. They vomited fire and flame
against their adversaries, and covered them with the most
scurrilous abuse.<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> All means were good in their eyes; they
picked out a few words here and there, neglecting the context
that might explain the passage quoted; substituted expressions
of their own for those of the doctors they criminated,
and omitted or added, according as it was necessary to blacken
their adversaries' characters.<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> We have this on the testimony
of Erasmus himself.</p>

<p>Nothing excited their wrath so much as the fundamental
doctrine of Christianity and of the Reformation,&mdash;salvation
by grace. "When I see these three men," said Beda, "Lefevre,
Erasmus, and Luther, in other respects endowed with
so penetrating a genius, uniting and conspiring against meritorious
works, and resting all the weight of salvation on
faith alone,<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> I am no longer astonished that thousands of
men, seduced by these doctrines, have learned to say: 'Why
should I fast and mortify my body?' Let us banish from
France this hateful doctrine of grace. This neglect of good
works is a fatal delusion from the devil."</p>

<div class="sidenote">JURISPRUDENCE AND THE GOSPEL.</div>

<p>In such language did the Syndic of the Sorbonne endeavour
to fight against the faith. He was destined to find
supporters in a debauched court, and in another part of the
nation more respectable, but not less opposed to the Gospel;
I mean those grave men, those rigid moralists, who, devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
to the study of laws and forms of jurisprudence, regard Christianity
as no more than a system of legislation; the Church,
as a moral police; and who, unable to adapt to those principles
of jurisprudence which absorb their whole thoughts
the doctrines of the spiritual inability of man, of the new
birth, and of justification by faith, look upon them as fanciful
dreams, dangerous to public morals and the prosperity of
the state. This hostile tendency to the doctrine of grace was
manifested in the sixteenth century by two very different excesses;
in Italy and Poland by the doctrine of Socinus, the
descendant of an illustrious family of lawyers at Sienna; and
in France by the persecuting decrees and burning piles of
the parliament.</p>

<p>The parliament, in fact, despising the great truths of the
Gospel which the reformers announced, and thinking themselves
called upon to do something in so overwhelming a
catastrophe, presented an address to Louisa of Savoy, full
of strong remonstrances on the conduct of the government
with regard to the new doctrine. "Heresy," said they,
"has raised its head among us, and the king, by neglecting
to bring the heretics to the scaffold, has drawn down the
wrath of heaven upon the nation."</p>

<p>At the same time the pulpits resounded with lamentations,
threats, and maledictions; prompt and exemplary punishments
were loudly called for. Martial Mazurier was particularly
distinguished among the preachers of Paris; and
endeavouring by his violence to efface the recollection of his
former connexion with the partisans of the Reformation, he
declaimed against the "secret disciples of Luther." "Do
you know the rapid operation of this poison?" exclaimed he.
"Do you know its potency? Well may we tremble for
France; as it works with inconceivable activity, and in a
short time may destroy thousands of souls."<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LOUISA CONSULTS THE SORBONNE AND THE POPE.</div>

<p>It was not difficult to excite the regent against the partisans
of the Reformation. Her daughter Margaret, the first
personage of the court, Louisa of Savoy herself, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
always been so devoted to the Roman pontiff, were pointed
at by certain fanatics as countenancing Lefevre, Berquin, and
the other innovators. Had she not read their tracts and
their translations of the Bible? The queen-mother desired
to clear herself of such outrageous suspicions. Already she
had despatched her confessor to the Sorbonne to consult that
body on the means of extirpating this heresy. "The damnable
doctrine of Luther," said she to the faculty, "is every
day gaining new adherents." The faculty smiled on the receipt
of this message. Till then, its representations had not
been listened to, and now their advice was humbly solicited
in the matter. At length they held within their grasp that
heresy they had so long desired to stifle. They commissioned
Noel Beda to return an immediate answer to the regent.
"Seeing that the sermons, the discussions, the books with
which we have so often opposed heresy, have failed in destroying
it," said the fanatical syndic, "all the writings of the
heretics should be prohibited by a royal proclamation; and
if this means does not suffice, we must employ force and
constraint against the <i>persons</i> of these false doctors; for
those who resist the light must be subdued by <i>torture</i> and by
<i>terror</i>."<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">COMMISSION AGAINST THE HERETICS.</div>

<p>But Louisa had not waited for this reply. Francis had
scarcely fallen into the hands of the emperor before she wrote
to the pope to know his pleasure concerning the heretics.
It was of great importance to Louisa's policy to secure the
favour of a pontiff who could raise all Italy against the victor
of Pavia, and she was ready to conciliate him at the cost of
a little French blood. The pope, delighted that he could
wreak his vengeance in the "most Christian kingdom" against
a heresy that he could not destroy either in Switzerland or
Germany, gave immediate orders for the introduction of the
Inquisition into France, and addressed a brief to the parliament.
At the same time Duprat, whom the pontiff had
created cardinal, and on whom he had conferred the archbishopric
of Sens, and a rich abbey, laboured to respond to
the favours of the court of Rome by the display of indefatigable
animosity against the heretics. Thus the pope, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
regent, the doctors of the Sorbonne, the parliament, and the
chancellor, with the most ignorant and fanatical part of the
nation, were conspiring together to ruin the Gospel and put
its confessors to death.</p>

<p>The parliament took the lead. Nothing less than the first
body in the kingdom was required to begin the campaign
against this doctrine, and moreover, was it not their peculiar
business, since the public safety was at stake? Accordingly
the parliament, "influenced by a holy zeal and fervour
against these novelties,<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> issued a decree to the effect that the
Bishop of Paris and the other prelates should be bound to
commission Messieurs Philip Pot, president of requests, and
Andrew Verjus, councillor, and Messieurs William Duchesne
and Nicholas Leclerc, doctors of divinity, to institute and
conduct the trial of those who should be tainted with the
Lutheran doctrine.</p>

<p>"And that it might appear that these commissioners were
acting rather under the authority of the Church than of the
parliament, it has pleased his holiness to send his brief of
the 20th of May 1525, approving of the appointment of the
said commissioners.</p>

<p>"In consequence of which, all those who were declared
Lutherans by the bishop or ecclesiastical judges to these
deputies, were delivered over to the secular arm, that is to
say, to the aforesaid parliament, which thereupon condemned
them to be burnt alive."<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a></p>

<p>This is the language of a manuscript of the time.</p>

<p>Such was the terrible commission of inquiry appointed
during the captivity of Francis I. against the evangelical
Christians of France on the ground of public safety. It
was composed of two laymen and two ecclesiastics, and
one of the latter was Duchesne, after Beda, the most fanatical
doctor of the Sorbonne. They had sufficient modesty
not to place him at their head, but his influence was only
the more secure on that account.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARGES AGAINST BRIÇONNET.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>Thus the machine was wound up; its springs were well
prepared; death would be the result of each of its blows.
It now became a question on whom they should make their
first attack. Beda, Duchesne, and Leclerc, assisted by
Philip Pot the president, and Andrew Verjus the councillor,
met to deliberate on this important point. Was there not
the Count of Montbrun, the old friend of Louis XII., and
formerly ambassador at Rome,&mdash;Briçonnet, bishop of Meaux?
The committee of public safety, assembled in Paris in 1525,
thought that by commencing with a man in so exalted a
station, they would be sure to spread dismay throughout the
kingdom. This was a sufficient reason, and the venerable
bishop was impeached.</p>

<p>It is true that Briçonnet had given guarantees of submission
to Rome, to the parliament, and to the popular superstitions;
but it was strongly suspected that he had done so
merely to ward off the blow about to fall upon him, and
that he was still countenancing heresy in secret. It would
appear that, after giving way, he had partly regained his
courage;&mdash;a circumstance quite in harmony with these
irresolute characters, who are tossed about and driven to and
fro, as the waves of the sea by the wind. Several acts were
ascribed to him in different places that would have been the
most signal retractation of his unhappy decrees of 1523 and
1524. The more eminent his rank in the Church and in
the State, the more fatal was his example, and the more
necessary also was it to obtain from him a striking recantation
of his errors, or to inflict upon him a still more notorious
punishment. The commission of inquiry eagerly collected
the evidence against him. They took account of the kindly
reception the bishop had given to the heretics; they stated
that, a week after the superior of the Cordeliers had preached
in St. Martin's Church at Meaux, conformably to the instructions
of the Sorbonne, to restore sound doctrine, Briçonnet
himself had gone into the pulpit, and publicly refuted
the orator, calling him and the other Grayfriars bigots,
hypocrites, and false prophets; and that, not content with
this public affront, he had, through his official, summoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
the superior to appear before him in person.<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> It would even
appear from a manuscript of the times that the bishop had gone
much farther, and that in the autumn of 1524, accompanied
by Lefevre of Etaples, he had spent three months in travelling
through his diocese, and had burnt all the images, save
the crucifix alone. Such daring conduct, which would prove
Briçonnet to have possessed great boldness combined with
much timidity, cannot if it be true, fix upon him the blame
attached to other image-breakers; for he was at the head of
that Church whose superstitions he was reforming, and was
acting in the sphere of his rights and duties.<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FACULTY OF PARIS.</div>

<p>Be that as it may, Briçonnet could not fail of being guilty
in the eyes of the enemies of the Gospel. He had not only
attacked the Church in general; he had grappled with the
Sorbonne itself, that body whose supreme law was its own
glory and preservation. Accordingly it was delighted on
hearing of the examination instituted against its adversary;
and John Bochart, one of the most celebrated advocates of
the times, supporting the charge against Briçonnet before the
parliament, cried out, elevating his voice: "Against the
Faculty, neither the Bishop of Meaux nor any private individual
may raise his head or open his mouth. Nor is the
Faculty called upon to enter into discussion, to produce and
set forth its reasons before the said bishop, who ought not
to resist the wisdom of that holy society, which he should
regard as aided of God."<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ALARM OF THE BISHOP.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>In consequence of this requisition, the parliament issued a
decree on the 3d October 1525, by which, after authorizing
the arrest of all those who had been informed against,
it ordered that the bishop should be interrogated by James
Menager and Andrew Verjus, councillors of the court, touching
the facts of which he was accused.<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a></p>

<p>This decree of the parliament amazed the bishop. Briçonnet,
the ambassador of two kings&mdash;Briçonnet, a bishop and
a prince, the friend of Louis XII. and Francis I.&mdash;to submit
to an examination by two councillors of the court!......He
who had hoped that God would kindle in the heart of
the king, of his mother, and of his sister, a fire that would
spread over the whole nation, now saw the nation turning
against him to extinguish the flame which he had received
from heaven. The king is a prisoner, his mother is at the
head of the enemies of the Gospel, and Margaret, alarmed at
the misfortunes that burst upon France, dares not ward off
the blows that are about to fall on her dearest friends, and
directed first against that spiritual father who has so often
consoled her; or, if she dares, she cannot. Quite recently
she had written to Briçonnet a letter full of pious outpourings:
"Oh! that my poor, lifeless heart could feel
some spark of love, with which I desire it were burnt to
ashes."<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a> But now it was a question of literal burning.
This mystic language was no longer in season; and whoever
now desired to confess his faith, must brave the scaffold.
The poor bishop, who had so earnestly hoped to see an
evangelical reform gradually and gently making its way into
every heart, was frightened, and trembled as he saw that he
must now purchase it at the cost of his life. Never perhaps
had this terrible thought occurred to him, and he recoiled from
it in agony and affright.</p>

<div class="sidenote">APPEAL TO PARLIAMENT&mdash;TEMPTATION.</div>

<p>Yet Briçonnet had still one hope: if he were permitted to
appear before the assembled chambers of parliament, as became
a person of his rank, in that august and numerous court,
he would be sure to find generous hearts responding to his
appeal, and undertaking his defence. He therefore entreated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
the court to grant him this favour; but his enemies had
equally reckoned on the issue of such a hearing. Had they
not seen Luther appearing before the German diet and shaking
the most determined hearts? On the watch to remove
every chance of safety, they exerted themselves to such
effect that the parliament refused Briçonnet this favour by
a decree dated the 25th of October 1525, in confirmation of
the one previously issued.<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a></p>

<p>Here then was the Bishop of Meaux referred like the
humblest priest to the jurisdiction of James Menager and
Andrew Verjus. These two lawyers, docile instruments in
the hands of the Sorbonne, would not be moved by those
higher considerations to which the whole chamber might have
been sensible; they were matter of fact men: had the bishop
differed from that society, or had he not? This is all they
desire to know. Briçonnet's conviction was therefore secured.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BISHOP FALLS AWAY.</div>

<p>While the parliament was thus holding the sword over
the head of the bishop, the monks, priests, and doctors were
not idle; they saw that Briçonnet's retractation would be of
more service to them than his punishment. His death
would only inflame the zeal of all those who held the same
faith with him; but his apostacy would plunge them into
the deepest discouragement. They went to work accordingly.
They visited and entreated him, Martial Mazurier
in particular endeavouring to make him fall, as he had done
himself. There was no lack of arguments which might appear
specious to Briçonnet. Would he like to be deprived
of his functions? Could he not, by remaining in the church,
employ his influence with the king and the court to effect an
incalculable amount of good? What would become of his
old friends, when he was no longer in power? Might not
his resistance compromise a reform, which, to be salutary
and durable, should be carried out by the legitimate influence
of the clergy? How many souls he would offend by
resisting the Church; how many souls he would attract, on
the contrary, by giving way!......They, like himself, were
anxious for a reform. All is advancing insensibly; at the
court and in the city and provinces, everything is moving forward......and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
would he in mere recklessness of heart destroy
so fair a prospect!......After all, they did not call upon him
to sacrifice his opinions, but only to submit to the established
order of the Church. Was it well in him, when
France was labouring under so many reverses, to stir up
new confusions? "In the name of religion, of your country,
of your friends, and of the Reformation itself, be persuaded,"
said they. By such sophisms are the noblest
causes ruined.</p>

<p>Yet every one of these considerations had its influence on
the mind of the bishop. The tempter, who desired to make
our Saviour fall in the wilderness, thus presented himself to
Briçonnet in specious colours, but instead of saying with his
Master: "Get thee behind me, Satan!" he listened, welcomed,
and pondered on these suggestions. From that hour
his fidelity was at an end.</p>

<p>Briçonnet had never embarked with his whole heart, like
Luther or Farel, in the movement that was then regenerating
the Church; there was in him a certain mystical tendency
which weakens men's minds, and deprives them of that firmness
and courage which proceed from faith alone based on
the Word of God. The cross that he was called to take
up that he might follow Christ was too heavy.<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> Shaken,
alarmed, stupified, and distracted,<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> he stumbled against the
stone which had been artfully placed in his path......he
fell, and instead of throwing himself into the arms of Jesus,
he threw himself into those of Mazurier,<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> and by a shameful
recantation sullied the glory of a noble faithfulness.<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CONSEQUENCES&mdash;RETRACTATION.</div>

<p>Thus fell Briçonnet, the friend of Lefevre and of Margaret;
thus the earliest supporter of the Gospel in France
denied the glad tidings of grace, in the guilty thought that
if he remained faithful, he would lose his influence over
the Church, the court, and France. But what was represented
to him as the salvation of his country, perhaps became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
its ruin. What would have been the result if Briçonnet had
possessed the courage of Luther? If one of the first bishops
of France, beloved by the king and by the people, had ascended
the scaffold, and had, like the little ones of the world,
sealed the truth of the Gospel by a bold confession and a
christian death, would not France herself have been moved;
and the blood of the bishop becoming, like that of Polycarp
and Cyprian, the seed of the Church, might we not have
seen that country, so illustrious in many respects, emerging
in the sixteenth century from that spiritual darkness with
which it is still clouded?</p>

<p>Briçonnet underwent a mere formal examination before
James Menager and Andrew Verjus, who declared that he
had sufficiently vindicated himself of the crime imputed to him.
He was then subjected to penance, and assembled a synod
in which he condemned Luther's books, retracted all that he
had taught contrary to the doctrine of the Church, restored
the invocation of saints, endeavoured to bring back those
who had forsaken the Romish worship, and wishing to leave
no doubt of his reconciliation with the pope and the Sorbonne,
kept a solemn fast on the eve of Corpus Christi, and
gave orders for pompous processions, in which he appeared
personally, still further testifying his faith by his magnificence
and by every kind of devout observance.<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> In his
will he commended his soul to the Virgin Mary and to the
heavenly choir of paradise, and desired that after his death
(which happened in 1533) twelve hundred masses should be
said for the repose of his soul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRIÇONNET AND FENELON&mdash;LEFEVRE ACCUSED.</div>

<p>The fall of Briçonnet is perhaps the most memorable in the
history of the Reformation. Nowhere else do we find a man
so sincerely pious and so deeply engaged in the reform turning
round so suddenly against it: yet we must clearly understand
his character and his fall. Briçonnet was, as regards
Rome, what Lefevre was with respect to the Reformation.
They were both persons of half-measures, properly belonging
to neither party. The doctor of Etaples inclined towards the
Word, while the Bishop of Meaux leaned to the hierarchy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
and when these two men who touch each other were called
upon to decide, the one ranged himself under the banner of
Rome, and the other of Jesus Christ. We cannot, however,
be sure that Briçonnet was wholly untrue to the convictions of
his faith; at no period after his recantation did the Romish
doctors place entire confidence in him. But he acted, perhaps,
as the Archbishop of Cambray afterwards did, and whom he
resembled in many points; he thought he might submit
outwardly to the pope, while remaining inwardly subject to
his old convictions. Such weakness is incompatible with the
principles of the Reformation. Briçonnet was one of the
chiefs of the mystic or quietist school in France, and we
know that one of its leading maxims has ever been to accommodate
itself to the church in which it exists, whatever
that church may be.</p>

<p>Briçonnet's guilty fall went to the hearts of his old friends,
and was the sad forerunner of those lamentable apostacies
which the spirit of the world so often obtained in France in
another age. The man who seemed to hold the reins of the
Reformation in his hand was suddenly thrown from his seat;
and the Reformation was thenceforward destined to pursue
its course in France, without a human leader, without a
chief, in humility and in obscurity. But the disciples of the
Gospel raised their heads, and from that time looked with a
firmer faith towards that heavenly Guide, whose faithfulness
they knew could not be shaken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONDEMNATION AND FLIGHT.</div>

<p>The Sorbonne triumphed; this was a great stride towards
the destruction of the Reform in France; and it was important
to achieve another victory without delay. Lefevre
stood next after Briçonnet. Accordingly Beda had immediately
turned the attack against him, by publishing a book
against this illustrious doctor, full of such gross calumnies,
that Erasmus says, "even smiths and cobblers could have
pointed them out." His fury was particularly excited by
the doctrine of justification through faith, which Lefevre was
the first to preach to Christendom in the sixteenth century.
To this point Beda continually recurred, as an article which,
according to him, overturned the Church. "What!" said he,
"Lefevre affirms that whoever places his salvation in himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
will surely perish; while the man that lays aside all strength
of his own, and throws himself entirely into the arms of Jesus
Christ, will be saved!......Oh, what heresy! to teach the inefficacy
of meritorious works!......What a hellish error! what
a deceitful snare of the devil! Let us oppose it with all
our might!"<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a></p>

<p>That engine of persecution which produces either retractation
or death, was immediately turned against the doctor of Etaples;
and hopes were already entertained of seeing Lefevre share
the fate of the poor wool-comber or of the illustrious Briçonnet.
His accusation was soon drawn up; and a decree of
the parliament (dated 28th August 1525) condemned nine
propositions extracted from his commentaries on the Gospels,
and placed his translation of the Scriptures in the list of prohibited
books.<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a></p>

<p>This was only the prelude; and that the learned doctor
knew. Upon the first symptoms of persecution, he had felt
that, in the absence of Francis I., he must fall under the
assault of his enemies, and that the moment was now come
to obey the Lord's commandment: <i>When they persecute you
in one city, flee ye into another</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> Lefevre quitted Meaux,
where, after the bishop's apostacy, he had drunk nothing
but the cup of bitterness, and saw all his activity paralyzed;
and as he withdrew from his persecutors, he shook the dust
from off his feet against them, "not to call down evil upon
them, but as a sign of the evils that were in store for
them; for (says he in one place) just as this dust is shaken
from off our feet, are they cast off from the face of the
Lord."<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a></p>

<p>The persecutors had missed their victim; but they consoled
themselves with the thought that France was at least
delivered from the father of the heretics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEFEVRE AT STRASBURG&mdash;FAREL AND LEFEVRE MEET.</div>

<p>The fugitive Lefevre arrived at Strasburg under a borrowed
name; there he immediately united with the friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
of the Reformation; and what must have been his joy at
hearing that Gospel publicly taught which he had been
the first to bring forward in the Church! Lo, there was his
faith! this was exactly what he had intended to teach!
He seemed to have been born a second time to the christian
life. Gerard Roussel, one of those evangelical men who,
like the doctor of Etaples, did not attain complete emancipation,
had also been compelled to quit France. Together
they followed the teaching of Capito and Bueer;<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> they had
frequent private conversations with these faithful doctors,<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a>
and a report was circulated that they had even been commissioned
to do so by Margaret, the king's sister.<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> But
Lefevre was more occupied in contemplating the ways of God
than with polemics. Casting his eyes over Christendom,
filled with astonishment on beholding the great events that
were taking place, moved with thankfulness, and his heart
full of anticipation, he fell on his knees and prayed the Lord
"to perfect that which he saw then beginning."<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a></p>

<p>One pleasure in particular awaited him in Strasburg;
Farel his disciple, his son, from whom he had been separated
by persecution for nearly three years, had arrived there
before him. The aged doctor of the Sorbonne found in his
young pupil a man in the vigour of life, a Christian in
all the energy of faith. Farel affectionately clasped that
wrinkled hand which had guided his first steps, and he experienced
an indescribable joy at again meeting with his
father in an evangelical city, and on seeing him surrounded
with faithful men. Together they listened to the pure instructions
of illustrious teachers; together they partook of
the Lord's Supper in conformity with Christ's institution; together
they received touching proofs of the love of their brethren.
"Do you remember," said Farel, "what you once observed
to me when we were both sunk in darkness: William,
God will renew the world, and you will see it!......Here is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
beginning of what you then told me."&mdash;"Yes:" answered the
pious old man, "God is renewing the world......My dear son,
continue to preach boldly the holy Gospel of Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A CITY OF REFUGE&mdash;LOUIS BERQUIN.</div>

<p>Lefevre, from excess of caution doubtless, wished to
live unknown at Strasburg, and had taken the name of
Anthony Pilgrim, while Roussel assumed that of Solnin.
But the illustrious doctor could not remain hidden; in a
short time the whole city and the very children saluted the
aged Frenchman with respect.<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a> He did not dwell alone;
but resided in Capito's house with Farel, Roussel, Vedastus,
who was eulogized for his diffidence, and a certain Simon, a
converted Jew. The houses of Capito, &OElig;colampadius,
Zwingle, and Luther, were then like inns. Such was at that
time the strength of brotherly love. Many other Frenchmen
were living in this city on the banks of the Rhine, and they
founded a church in which Farel often preached the doctrine
of salvation. This Christian society soothed the pain of exile.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COMPLAINT OF THE PRISONER&mdash;ERASMUS.</div>

<p>While these brethren were thus enjoying the asylum
offered them by fraternal affection, those in Paris and in
other parts of France were exposed to great dangers. Briçonnet
had retracted; Lefevre had quitted France; this was
no doubt something for the Sorbonne; but it had still to
wait for the punishments that it had advised. Beda and his
party had found no victims......one man exasperated them
still more than Briçonnet and Lefevre; this was Louis Berquin.
The gentleman of Artois, of a more decided character
than his two masters, omitted no opportunity of tormenting
the monks and theologians, and of unmasking their fanaticism.
Living by turns at Paris and in the provinces, he
collected and translated the writings of Luther and Erasmus:<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a>
he himself would compose controversial works, and
defend and propagate the new doctrine with all the zeal of a
new convert. The Bishop of Amiens denounced him; Beda
seconded the charge; and the parliament had him thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
into prison. "This one," said they, "shall not escape us like
Briçonnet or Lefevre." In effect, they kept him in close confinement.
In vain did the superior of the Carthusians and
others entreat him to apologize; he boldly declared that he
would not give way on a single point. "There seemed no
way left," says a chronicler, "but to lead him to the stake."<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a></p>

<p>Margaret, in consternation at what had happened to Briçonnet,
dreaded to see Berquin dragged to that scaffold which
the bishop had so shamefully escaped. Not daring to visit
him in prison, she endeavoured to convey a few words of
consolation to him; and it was perhaps for him that the
princess composed this touching complaint of the prisoner, in
which the latter, addressing the Lord, exclaims:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">But yet, where'er my prison be,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Its gates can never keep out Thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For instant where I am, Thou art with me.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Margaret did not stop here; she instantly wrote to
her brother, soliciting this gentleman's pardon. Happy
would she be if she could deliver him in time from the
hatred of his enemies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ERASMUS ATTACKED&mdash;HIS DEFENCE.</div>

<p>While waiting for this victim, Beda resolved to intimidate
the enemies of the Sorbonne and of the monks by crushing
the most celebrated of them. Erasmus had taken up the
pen against Luther; but that was of little consequence. If
they can succeed in destroying Erasmus, with much the
stronger reason would the ruin of Farel, of Luther, and of their
associates be inevitable. The surest way to reach the mark
is to aim beyond it. When once Rome has placed her foot
upon the neck of the philosopher of Rotterdam, where is the
heretical doctor that can escape its vengeance? Lecouturier,
commonly known by his Latin name <i>Sutor</i> (cobbler), had
already begun the attack, by launching from his solitary
Carthusian cell a treatise overflowing with violence, in which
he called his opponents theologasters and jackasses, charging
them with scandalous crimes, heresy, and blasphemy.
Treating of subjects which he did not understand, he reminded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
his readers of the old proverb: <i>Ne sutor ultra crepidam</i>, Let
the cobbler stick to his last.</p>

<p>Beda hastened to the assistance of his brother. He ordered
Erasmus to write no more;<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> and taking up that pen which
he had commanded the greatest writer of the age to lay
down, he made a collection of all the calumnies that the
monks had invented against the illustrious philosopher,
translated them into French, and composed a book that he
circulated in the city and at court, striving to raise all France
against him.<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> This work was the signal of attack; Erasmus
was assailed from every quarter. An old Carmelite of
Louvain, Nicholas Ecmond, exclaimed every time he went
into the pulpit, "There is no difference between Luther and

wherever the Carmelite might be, at table, in coach, or in
boat, he called Erasmus a heresiarch and forger.<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> The
faculty of Paris, excited by these clamours, prepared a censure
against the illustrious writer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">APPEAL TO THE KING AND THE EMPEROR.</div>

<p>Erasmus was astounded. This, then, is the end of all his
forbearance, and of even his hostility against Luther. He
had mounted to the breach with greater courage than any
man; and now they want to make him a stepping stone,
and trample him under foot, that they may the more securely
attack the common enemy. This idea disgusted him: he
turned round immediately, and almost before he had ceased
his attack upon Luther, fell upon these fanatical doctors,
who had assailed him from behind. Never was his correspondence
more active than now. He glances all around
him, and his piercing eye soon discovers in whose hands
depends his fate. He does not hesitate: he will lay his
complaints and remonstrances at the feet of the Sorbonne, of
the parliament, of the king, and of the emperor himself.
"What is it that has kindled this immense Lutheran conflagration?"
wrote he to those theologians of the Sorbonne, from
whom he still expected some little impartiality; "what has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
fanned it, if not the virulence of Beda and his fellows?<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> In
war, a soldier who has done his duty receives a reward from
his general; and all the recompense I shall receive from
you, the leaders in this war, is to be delivered up to the
calumnies of such as Beda and Lecouturier."</p>

<p>"What!" wrote he to the parliament, "when I was contending
with these Lutherans, and while I was maintaining
a severe struggle by order of the emperor, the pope, and
other princes, even at the peril of my life, Beda and Lecouturier
attacked me from behind with their foul libels! Ah, if
fortune had not deprived us of King Francis, I should have
invoked this avenger of the muses against this new invasion
of the barbarians.<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> But now it is your duty to put an end
to such injustice!"</p>

<p>As soon as he found the possibility of conveying a letter
to the king, he wrote to him immediately. His penetrating
eye detected in these fanatical doctors of the Sorbonne the
germs of the league, the predecessors of those three priests
who were one day to set up the <i>Sixteen</i> against the last of
the Valois; his genius forewarned the king of the crimes
and misfortunes which his descendants were destined to
know but too well. "Religion is their pretext," said he,
"but they aspire to tyranny even over princes. They move
with a sure step, though their path is underground. Should
the prince be disinclined to submit to them in every thing,
they will declare that he may be deposed by the Church;
that is to say, by a few false monks and theologians who
conspire against the public peace."<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> Erasmus in writing
to Francis I. could not have touched a tenderer point.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PARIS AND LORRAINE&mdash;ESCH IMPRISONED.</div>

<p>Finally, to be more certain of escape from his enemies,
Erasmus invoked the protection of Charles V. "Invincible
emperor," said he, "certain individuals who, under the pretence
of religion, wish to establish their own gluttony and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
despotism, are raising a horrible outcry against me.<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> I
am fighting under your banners and those of Jesus Christ.
May your wisdom and power restore peace to the Christian
world."</p>

<p>Thus did the prince of letters address the great ones of the
age. The danger was averted; the powers of the world
interposed; the vultures were compelled to abandon a prey
which they fancied already in their talons. Upon this they
turned their eyes to another quarter, seeking fresh victims,
which were soon found.</p>

<p>Lorraine was the first place in which blood was again to
flow. From the earliest days of the Reform there had been
a fanatical alliance between Paris and the country of the
Guises. When Paris was quiet, Lorraine applied to the
task; and then Paris resumed her labour, while Metz and
Nancy were recovering their strength. In June 1525, Peter
Toussaint returned to Metz, in company with Farel. They
desired a hearing before their lordships <i>the Thirteen</i>; and
this being refused, they appealed to the <i>eschevin</i>. Plans
were already laid for throwing them into prison, when, fearful
of danger, they quickly left the city, travelling all night lest
they should be overtaken.<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ESCH IMPRISONED&mdash;SCHUCH AT NANCY.</div>

<p>The first blows were destined apparently to fall on an
excellent man, one of the Basle refugees, a friend of Farel
and Toussaint. The Chevalier d'Esch had not been able to
escape the suspicions of the priests in Metz. They discovered
that he kept up a communication with the evangelical
Christians, and he was imprisoned at Pont-a-Mousson, about
five miles from Metz on the banks of the Moselle<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a> These
tidings overwhelmed the French refugees and the Swiss themselves
with sorrow. "O heart full of innocence!" exclaimed
&OElig;colampadius. "I have confidence in the Lord," added he,
"that he will preserve this man to us, either in life as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
preacher of righteousness, to announce His name, or as a
martyr to confess him in death."<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> But at the same time
&OElig;colampadius disapproved of the impetuosity, enthusiasm,
and imprudent zeal which distinguished the French refugees.
"I wish," said he, "that my very dear lords of France would
not be so hasty in returning into their own country, before
they had duly examined all things;<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> for the devil is spreading
his snares on every side. Nevertheless let them obey
the Spirit of Christ, and may this Spirit never abandon
them."</p>

<p>There was, in truth, reason to fear for the chevalier. The
fury of the enemy had broken out in Lorraine with redoubled
violence. The provincial of the Cordeliers, Bonaventure
Renel, confessor to Duke Anthony the Good, a man devoid
of shame, and not very commendable on the score of morals,
gave this weak prince, who reigned from 1508 to 1544, great
licence in his pleasures, and persuaded him, almost by way
of penance, to destroy the innovators without mercy. "It
is enough for every one to know his <i>Pater</i> and his <i>Ave</i>"
this prince, so well tutored by Renel, would say; "the greater
the doctor, the greater the disturbance."<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a></p>

<p>Towards the end of 1524 the duke's court was informed
that a pastor named Schuch was preaching some new
doctrine in the town of St. Hippolyte, at the foot of the
Vosges. "Let them return to their duty," said Anthony
<i>the Good</i>, "or else I will march against the city, and destroy
it by fire and sword."<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS CONDEMNATION AND MARTYRDOM.</div>

<p>Upon this the faithful pastor resolved to give himself up
for his flock, and repaired to Nancy, where the prince was
residing. As soon as he arrived he was thrown into a
filthy prison, under the guard of brutal and cruel men; and
Friar Bonaventure at last saw the heretic in his power. It
was he who presided at the trial. "Heretic! Judas! devil!"
exclaimed he. Schuch, calm and collected, made no reply to
this abuse; but holding in his hands a Bible, all covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
with notes, he meekly yet forcibly confessed Christ crucified.
On a sudden he became animated; he stood up boldly,
and raising his voice, as if filled by the Spirit from on high,
looked his judges in the face, and threatened them with the
terrible judgments of God.</p>

<p>Brother Bonaventure and his companions, amazed and
transported with rage, rushed upon him with violent cries, tore
away the Bible from which he was reading this menacing
language, "and like mad dogs," says the chronicler, "unable
to bite his doctrine, they burnt it in their convent."<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a></p>

<p>All the court of Lorraine resounded with the obstinacy and
impudence of the minister of St. Hippolyte, and the prince,
curious to hear the heretic, desired to be present at his last
interrogatory, but in secret however, and concealed from
every eye. As the examination took place in Latin, he
could not understand a word; but he was struck with the
firm countenance of the minister, who seemed neither vanquished
nor confounded. Exasperated at such obstinacy,
Anthony the Good rose up, and said as he withdrew:
"Why do you still dispute? He denies the sacrament of
the mass; let them proceed to execution against him."<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a>
Schuch was instantly condemned to be burnt alive. When
the sentence was made known to him, he raised his eyes to
heaven, saying mildly: "I was glad when they said unto
me, let us go into the house of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a></p>

<p>On the 19th August 1525 the whole city of Nancy was in
motion. The bells were tolling for the death of a heretic. The
mournful procession set out. It was necessary to pass before
the convent of the Cordeliers, who, rejoicing and expectant,
had assembled before the gate. At the moment that Schuch
appeared, Father Bonaventure, pointing to the carved images
over the portals of the convent, exclaimed: "Heretic! pay
honour to God, to his mother, and to the saints."&mdash;"Ye
hypocrites!" replied Schuch, standing erect before these
blocks of wood and stone, "God will destroy you, and bring
your deceits to light!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">BEDA'S CONTEST WITH CAROLI</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>When the martyr reached the place of execution, his
books were burnt before his face; he was then called
upon to retract; but he refused, saying: "It is thou, O
God, who hast called me, and thou wilt give me strength
unto the end."<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> After this he began to repeat aloud the
fifty-first psalm: "Have mercy upon me, O Lord, according
to thy loving kindness." Having mounted the pile, he
continued to recite the psalm until the smoke and the flames
stifled his voice.</p>

<p>Thus the persecutors of France and Lorraine beheld a
renewal of their victories; at length men paid attention to
their advice. The ashes of a heretic had been scattered to
the winds at Nancy; it was a challenge to the capital of
France. What! shall Beda and Lecouturier be the last
to show their zeal for the pope! Let flames reply to flames,
and heresy, swept from the soil of the kingdom, would soon
be entirely driven back beyond the Rhine.</p>

<p>But before he could succeed, Beda had to sustain a
combat, half serious, half ludicrous, against one of those men
with whom the struggle against the Papacy is merely
an intellectual pastime and not an earnest purpose of the
heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONTEST WITH CAROLI&mdash;PAVANNE'S DEJECTION.</div>

<p>Among the scholars whom Briçonnet had attracted to his
diocese, was a doctor of the Sorbonne, named Peter Caroli,
a vain and frivolous man, not less quarrelsome and litigious
than Beda himself. In the new doctrine Caroli saw the
means of vexing Beda, whose ascendency he could not
endure. Accordingly, on his return from Meaux to Paris, he
made a great sensation by carrying into the pulpit what was
called, "the new way of preaching." Then began an indefatigable
struggle between the two doctors; it was blow for
blow, and trick for trick. Beda summoned Caroli before the
Sorbonne, and Caroli summoned him before the bishop's
court by way of reparation. The faculty continued the examination,
and Caroli gave notice of an appeal to the
parliament. He was provisionally forbidden to enter the
pulpit, and he preached in all the churches of Paris. Being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
positively forbidden to preach at all, he publicly lectured on
the Psalms in the College of Cambray. The faculty forbade
him to continue his course, and he begged permission to
finish the explanation of the 22d Psalm, which he had just
begun. Finally, on the refusal of his request, he posted the
following placard on the college gates: "<i>Peter Caroli,
desirous of obeying the orders of the sacred faculty, has
ceased to lecture; he will resume his lectures (whenever it
shall please God) at the verse where he left off</i>: <span class="smcap">They have
pierced my hands and my feet</span>." Thus Beda at last found
his match. If Caroli had seriously defended the truth,
the burning pile would soon have been his reward; but he
was of too profane a spirit to be put to death. How could
the judges capitally punish a man who made them lose their
gravity. Neither the bishop's court, nor the parliament, nor
the council, could ever come to a definite decision in his
cause. Two men such as Caroli would have wearied out
the activity of Beda himself; but the Reformation did not
produce his parallel.<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a></p>

<p>As soon as this unseasonable contest was ended, Beda
applied to more serious matters. Happily for the syndic of
the Sorbonne, there were men who gave persecution a better
hold of them than Caroli. Briçonnet, Erasmus, Lefevre, and
Farel had escaped him; but since he cannot reach these distinguished
individuals, he will content himself with meaner
persons. The poor youth, James Pavanne, after his abjuration
at Christmas 1524, had done nothing but weep and
sigh. He might be seen with a melancholy air, his eyes
fixed on the earth, groaning inwardly, and severely reproaching
himself for having denied his Saviour and his God.<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS JOY AND MARTYRDOM&mdash;THE HERMIT.</div>

<p>Pavanne was undoubtedly the most diffident and inoffensive
of men: but what mattered that! he had been at Meaux,
and in those days that was sufficient. "Pavanne has relapsed,"
was the cry; "<i>the dog is turned to his own vomit
again, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
<i>mire</i>." He was immediately arrested, thrown into prison,
and taken before his judges. This was all that the youthful
James required. He felt comforted as soon as he was in
chains, and found strength sufficient to confess Jesus Christ
with boldness.<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> The cruel persecutors smiled as they saw
that, this time at least, nothing could save their victim;
there was no recantation, no flight, no powerful patronage.
The young man's mildness, his candour and courage, failed
to soften his adversaries. He regarded them with love;
for by casting him into prison, they had restored him to
tranquillity and joy; but his tender looks only served to
harden their hearts. His trial was soon concluded: a pile
was erected on the Grève, where Pavanne died rejoicing,
strengthening by his example all those who in that large city
believed openly or secretly in the Gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>This was not enough for the Sorbonne. If they are compelled
to sacrifice the little ones of the world, their number must
at least make amends for their quality. The flames of the
Grève struck terror into Paris and the whole of France;
but a new pile, kindled on another spot, will redouble that
terror. It will be talked of at court, in the colleges, and in
the workshops of the people; and such proofs will show more
clearly than any edicts, that Louisa of Savoy, the Sorbonne,
and the parliament, are resolved to sacrifice the very last
heretic to the anathemas of Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HERMIT OF LIVRY.</div>

<p>In the forest of Livry, three leagues from Paris, and not
far from the spot where once stood the ancient abbey of the
Augustines, dwelt a hermit, who in his excursions having
met with some men of Meaux, had received the evangelical
doctrine in his heart.<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> The poor hermit had felt himself
rich in his retreat, when one day, returning with the scanty
food that public charity bestowed on him, he carried back
Jesus Christ and his grace. From that time he found that
it was better to give than to receive. He went from house
to house in the surrounding villages, and as soon as he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
opened the doors of the poor peasants whom he visited in
their humble huts, he spoke to them of the Gospel, of the
perfect pardon that it offers to the burdened soul, and which
is far better than absolutions.<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> Erelong the good hermit of
Livry was known in the environs of Paris; people went to
visit him in his lowly cell, and he became a mild and fervent
missionary for the simple souls of that district.</p>

<p>The rumour of the doings of this new evangelist did not
fail to reach the ears of the Sorbonne and of the magistrates
of Paris. The hermit was seized, dragged from his hermitage,
from his forest, from those fields through which he
used to wander daily, thrown into a prison in that great city
which he had ever shunned, and condemned "to suffer the
exemplary punishment of the slow fire."<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS MARTYRDOM.</div>

<p>In order to render the example more striking, it was
determined that he should be burnt alive in the front of
Notre-Dame, before that splendid cathedral, that majestic
symbol of Roman-catholicism. All the clergy were convoked,
and as much pomp was displayed as on the most
solemn festivals.<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a> They would, if possible, have attracted
all Paris round the stake, "the great bell of the church of
Notre-Dame (says an historian) tolling solemnly to arouse
the citizens."<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> The people flocked in crowds through
all the streets that led into the square. The deep tones
of the bell drew the workman from his toil, the scholar
from his books, the merchant from his traffic, the soldier
from his idleness, and already the wide space was covered
by an immense crowd which still kept increasing. The
hermit, clad in the garments assigned to obstinate heretics,
with head and feet bare, had been led before the gates of
the cathedral. Calm, firm, and collected, he made no reply
to the exhortations of the confessors who presented him a
crucifix, save by declaring that his sole hope was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
pardon of God. The doctors of the Sorbonne, in the front
ranks of the spectators, seeing his constancy, and the
effect it was producing on the people, cried aloud: "He is
damned: they are leading him to hell-fire!"<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> The great
bell still continued tolling, and its loud notes, by stunning the
ears of the crowd, increased the solemnity of this mournful
spectacle. At length the bell was silent, and the martyr
having replied to the last questions of his enemies, that he
was resolved to die in the faith of his Lord Jesus Christ,
was burnt by a slow fire, according to the tenor of his sentence.
And thus, in front of Notre-Dame, amid the shouts
and emotion of a whole people, under the shadow of the
towers raised by the piety of Louis the younger, peacefully
died a man, whose name history has not transmitted to us,
except as the "Hermit of Livry."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A SCHOLAR OF NOYON.</div>

<p>While men were thus putting to death the first confessors
of Jesus Christ in France, God was preparing mightier ones
to fill their places. Beda hurried to the stake an unassuming
scholar, an humble hermit, and thought he was dragging
almost the whole of the Reform along with them. But Providence
has resources that are unknown to the world. The
Gospel, like the fabulous ph&oelig;nix, contains a principle of life
within itself, which the flames cannot consume, and it springs
up again from its own ashes. It is often at the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
when the storm is at its height, when the thunderbolt seems
to have struck down the truth, and when thick darkness hides
it from our view, that a sudden glimmering appears, the forerunner
of a great deliverance. At this time, when all human
powers in France were arming against the Gospel for the
complete destruction of the Reformation, God was preparing
an instrument, weak to all appearance, one day to support
His rights and to defend His cause with more than mortal
intrepidity. In the midst of the persecutions and blazing piles
that followed each other in close succession after Francis
became Charles's prisoner, let us fix our eyes on a youth, one
day to be called to the head of a great army in the holy warfare
of Israel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARACTER OF YOUNG CALVIN.</div>

<p>Among the inhabitants of the city and colleges of Paris
who heard the sound of the great bell was a young scholar
of sixteen, a native of Noyon in Picardy, of middle stature,
sallow features, and whose piercing eye and animated looks
announced a mind of no common sagacity.<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> His dress, extremely
neat but of perfect simplicity, betokened order and
moderation.<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> This young man, by name John Cauvin or
Calvin, was then studying at the college of La Marche, under
Mathurin Cordier, a rector celebrated for his probity, erudition,
and peculiar fitness for the instruction of youth.
Brought up in all the superstitions of popery, the scholar of
Noyon was blindly submissive to the Church, cheerfully complying
with all her observances,<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> and persuaded that the
heretics had richly deserved their fate. The blood which
was then flowing in Paris aggravated the crime of heresy in
his eyes. But although naturally of a timid and fearful
disposition, and which he himself has styled soft and pusillanimous,<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a>
he possessed that uprightness and generosity of
heart which lead a man to sacrifice everything to his convictions.
Accordingly, in vain had his youth been appalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
by those frightful spectacles, in vain had murderous flames
consumed the faithful disciples of the Gospel on the Grève
and in front of Notre-Dame; the recollection of these horrors
could not prevent him from one day entering on the new
path, which seemed to lead only to the prison or the stake.
Moreover, there were already perceptible in the character of
young Calvin certain traits that announced what he would
become. Strictness of morals in him led the way to strictness
of doctrine, and the scholar of sixteen already gave
promise of a man who would deal seriously with every principle
he embraced, and who would firmly require in others
what he himself found it so easy to perform. Quiet and
serious during his lessons, never sharing in the amusements
or follies of his schoolfellows during the hours of recreation,
holding himself aloof,<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> and filled with horror at sin, he would
often reprimand their disorders with severity and even bitterness.<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a>
And hence, as a canon of Noyon informs us, his
fellow-students nicknamed him the <i>accusative case</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> Among
them he was the representative of conscience and of duty, so
far was he from being as some of his calumniators have depicted
him. The pale features and the piercing eyes of the
scholar of sixteen had already inspired his comrades with
more respect than the black gowns of their masters; and
this Picard youth, of a timid air, who daily took his seat on
the benches in the college of La Marche, was even then, by
the seriousness of his conversation and life, an unconscious
minister and reformer.</p>

<p>It was not in these particulars alone that the youth of
Noyon was already far above his schoolfellows. His great
timidity sometimes prevented him from manifesting all the
horror he felt at vanity and vice; but he already consecrated
to study the whole force of his genius and of his will, and to
look at him one might see he was a man who would spend
his life in toil. He comprehended everything with inconceivable
facility; he ran in his studies while his companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
were lazily creeping along, and he impressed deeply on his
profound genius what others spend much time in learning
superficially. Accordingly, his master was compelled to take
him out of the classes, and introduce him singly to fresh
studies.<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CALVIN'S FATHER&mdash;THE MOMMORS</div>

<p>Among his fellow-students were the young De Mommors,
belonging to the first nobility of Picardy. John Calvin was
very intimate with them, especially with Claude, who afterwards
became abbot of Saint Eloi, and to whom he dedicated
his commentary on Seneca. It was in the company of these
young nobles that Calvin had come to Paris. His father,
Gerard Calvin, apostolic notary, procurator-fiscal of the
county of Noyon, secretary of the diocese, and proctor of the
chapter,<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> was a man of judgment and ability, whose talents
had raised him to offices sought after by the best families,
and who had gained the esteem of all the gentry in the province,
and in particular of the noble family of Mommor.<a name="FNanchor_1103_1103" id="FNanchor_1103_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a>
Gerard resided at Noyon;<a name="FNanchor_1104_1104" id="FNanchor_1104_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a> he had married a young woman
of Cambray, of remarkable beauty and unassuming piety,
by name Jane Lefranq, who had already borne him a son
named Charles, when on the 10th of July 1509 she gave
birth to a second son, who received the name of John, and
who was christened in the church of St. Godeberte.<a name="FNanchor_1105_1105" id="FNanchor_1105_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
third son, Anthony, who died young, and two daughters,
made up the family of the procurator-fiscal of Noyon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EARLY EDUCATION.</div>

<p>Gerard Calvin, living in familiar intercourse with the heads
of the clergy and the chief persons in the province, desired
that his children should receive the same education as those
of the best families. John, whose precocious habits he
had observed, was brought up with the sons of the Mommor
family; he lived in their house as one of themselves,
and studied the same lessons as Claude. In this family he
learnt the first elements of literature and of life; he thus
received a higher polish than he appeared destined to acquire.<a name="FNanchor_1106_1106" id="FNanchor_1106_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a>
He was afterwards sent to the college of the Capettes, founded
in the city of Noyon.<a name="FNanchor_1107_1107" id="FNanchor_1107_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> The child enjoyed but little recreation.
The austerity, that was one of the characteristic features
of the son, was found also in the father. Gerard
brought him up strictly; from his earliest years, John was
compelled to bend to the inflexible rule of duty, which soon
became habitual to him, and the influence of the father counteracted
that of the Mommor family. Calvin, who was of a
timid and somewhat rustic character (as he says himself),<a name="FNanchor_1108_1108" id="FNanchor_1108_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a>
and rendered still more timid by his father's severity, shrunk
from the splendid apartments of his protectors, and loved to
remain alone and in obscurity.<a name="FNanchor_1109_1109" id="FNanchor_1109_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a> Thus in retirement his
young mind formed itself to great thoughts. It would appear
that he sometimes went to the village of Pont l'Evêque,
near Noyon, where his grandfather resided in a small cottage,<a name="FNanchor_1110_1110" id="FNanchor_1110_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a>
and where other relatives also, who at a later period changed
their name from detestation of the heresiarch, kindly received
the son of the procurator-fiscal. But it was to study chiefly
that young Calvin devoted his time. While Luther, who
was to act upon the people, was brought up like a child of
the people, Calvin, who was to act especially as a theologian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
and profound reasoner, and become the legislator of the renovated
Church, received even in childhood a more liberal
education.<a name="FNanchor_1111_1111" id="FNanchor_1111_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DEVOTED TO THEOLOGY.</div>

<p>A spirit of piety early showed itself in the child's heart.
One author relates that he was accustomed, when very
young, to pray in the open air, under the vault of heaven;
a habit which contributed to awaken in his heart the sentiment
of God's omnipresence.<a name="FNanchor_1112_1112" id="FNanchor_1112_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> But although Calvin might,
even in infancy, have heard the voice of God in his heart,
no one at Noyon was so rigid as he in the observance of
ecclesiastical regulations. And hence Gerard, remarking
this disposition, conceived the design of devoting his son to
theology.<a name="FNanchor_1113_1113" id="FNanchor_1113_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> This prospect no doubt contributed to impress
on his soul that serious form, that theological stamp, by
which it was subsequently distinguished. His spirit was of
a nature to receive a strong impression in early years, and
to familiarize itself from childhood with the most elevated
thoughts. The report that he was at this time a chorister
has no foundation, as even his adversaries admit. But they
assure us that, when a child, he was seen joining the religious
processions, and carrying a sword with a cross-shaped
hilt by way of a crucifix.<a name="FNanchor_1114_1114" id="FNanchor_1114_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a> "A presage," add they, "of what
he was one day to become!" "The Lord hath made my
mouth like a sharp sword," says the servant of Jehovah in
Isaiah. The same may be said of Calvin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TONSURE&mdash;HE LEAVES NOYON.</div>

<p>Gerard was poor; his son's education had cost him much,
and he wished to attach him irrevocably to the Church. The
Cardinal of Lorraine had been coadjutor of the Bishop of
Metz at the age of four years. It was then a common practice
to confer ecclesiastical titles and revenues on children.
Alphonso of Portugal was made cardinal by Leo X. at the
age of eight, and Odet of Châtillon by Clement VII. at eleven;
and subsequent to Calvin's day, the celebrated Mère Angélique
of Port Royal was appointed coadjutrix of that nunnery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
at the age of seven years. Gerard, who died a good
catholic, was regarded with favour by Messire Charles de
Hangest, bishop of Noyon, and by his vicars-general. Accordingly,
when the chaplain of La Gésine resigned, the
bishop, on the 21st May 1521, conferred this benefice on
John Calvin, who was then nearly twelve years old. The
appointment was communicated to the chapter twelve days
after. On the eve of Corpus Christi, the bishop solemnly
cut off the child's hair;<a name="FNanchor_1115_1115" id="FNanchor_1115_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> and by this ceremony of the tonsure,
John became a member of the clergy, and capable of entering
into holy orders, and of holding a benefice without residing
on the spot.</p>

<p>Thus was Calvin called to make trial in his own person of
the abuses of the Romish Church. Of all who wore the
tonsure in France, there was none more serious in his piety
than the chaplain of La Gésine, and the serious child was
probably astonished himself at the work of the bishop and
his vicars-general. But in his simplicity he felt too much
veneration towards these exalted personages to indulge in
the least suspicion on the lawfulness of his tonsure. He had
held the title about two years when Noyon was visited by a
dreadful pestilence. Several of the canons petitioned the
chapter that they might be allowed to quit the city. Already
many of the inhabitants had been carried off by the <i>great
death</i>, and Gerard was beginning to fear that his son John,
the hope of his life, might in a moment be snatched from his
tenderness by the scourge of God. The young de Mommors
were going to Paris to continue their studies; this was what
the procurator-fiscal had always desired for his son. Why
should he separate John from his fellow-students? On the
5th of August 1523, he petitioned the chapter to procure the
young chaplain "liberty to go wherever he pleased during
the plague, without loss of his allowance; which was
granted him until the feast of Saint Remy."<a name="FNanchor_1116_1116" id="FNanchor_1116_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_1116_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> John Calvin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
quitted his father's house at the age of fourteen. It requires
great audacity in calumny to ascribe his departure to other
causes, and in mere wantonness challenge that disgrace which
justly recoils on those who circulate charges the falsehood
of which has been so authentically demonstrated. It appears
that in Paris, Calvin lodged at the house of one of his
uncles, Richard Cauvin, who resided near the church of St.
Germain l'Auxerrois. "Thus flying from the pestilence,"
says the canon of Noyon, "he went to catch it elsewhere."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TWO CALVINS&mdash;SLANDERS.</div>

<p>Some years after Calvin had quitted Noyon, another individual
of the same name arrived in that city.<a name="FNanchor_1117_1117" id="FNanchor_1117_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> John
Cauvin was a young man of corrupt principles, but as he
came from another part of France, and was a stranger (<i>or</i>
unknown) in Noyon, he was received among the priests who
chanted in the choir, and in a short time a chapel was
given him, as in the case of the first Calvin. As this took
place at a time when the latter had already "turned to
heresy," the good canons looked upon Cauvin's arrival as
a sort of recompense and consolation; but it was not long
before the disorderly life of this wretched man excited alarm
among his protectors. He was reprimanded, punished, and
even deprived of his stipend: but to this he paid no attention,<a name="FNanchor_1118_1118" id="FNanchor_1118_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a>
continually lapsing again into incontinence. "Seeing
then," says the canon, "his hardness of heart, which made
him neglect every kind of remonstrance," the canons deprived
John Cauvin of his chapel and expelled him from the
choir. James Desmay, a priest and doctor of divinity, who
had studied at Noyon everything that concerned this church,
adds, that he was privately scourged in 1552, and then
driven from the town.<a name="FNanchor_1119_1119" id="FNanchor_1119_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> This is indeed a disgraceful end for
a priest! The canon Levasseur disputes the scourging, but
admits all the rest.</p>

<p>In the following year the same circumstances happened
again, for the history of popery abounds in such adventures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>A certain Baldwin the younger, also chaplain at Noyon,
having taken to live scandalously with him certain women of
suspicious character,<a name="FNanchor_1120_1120" id="FNanchor_1120_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> was condemned to attend every service
in the church during a month, and to be scourged.<a name="FNanchor_1121_1121" id="FNanchor_1121_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a></p>

<p>While these two Romanist authors agree in relating the
disorders and punishments inflicted on these young ecclesiastics,
they likewise agree in declaring that they had found
nothing at Noyon or in its registers against the morals of
the great French reformer, and are content to execrate his
error; "for to call a man a heretic, is to call him by the
most opprobrious of names."<a name="FNanchor_1122_1122" id="FNanchor_1122_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a></p>

<p>The Dean of Noyon goes even farther in his zeal for
the papacy, and relates that John Cauvin, who had been
expelled in 1552 for incontinence, died a <i>good catholic</i>.
"Thanks be to God," adds he, "that he never turned his
coat, nor changed his religion, to which his libertine life and
the example of his namesake Calvin seemed to incline him."
The dean concludes his strange narrative, the discovery of
which is highly valuable to the history of the Reformation,
in these words: "I thought it my duty to add this chapter
to the history of the first Calvin the reformer, <i>ad diluendam
homonymiam</i> (to guard against the similarity of names), for
fear one should be taken for the other, the catholic for the
heretic."<a name="FNanchor_1123_1123" id="FNanchor_1123_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a></p>

<p>Never was fear better founded. We know what the
popish writers are accustomed to do. They take advantage
of the misdeeds of John Cauvin at Noyon, and ascribe
them to the reformer. They tell their readers gravely that
he was driven from his native town for misconduct, after
having been condemned to be scourged and even branded.
In spite of all the pains taken by the Dean of Noyon
to add a chapter <i>for fear one should be taken for the
other, the catholic for the heretic</i>, the apologists of Rome
fail not to ascribe to the reformer the debaucheries of his
namesake. What engrossed the thoughts of the canon of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
Noyon was the glory of John Cauvin who died a good
catholic, and he feared lest Calvin's heresy should be laid to
him. And, accordingly, he clearly assigns <i>incontinence</i> to the
one, and <i>heresy</i> to the other. There have indeed been <i>equivocations</i>,
as he says, but in a contrary direction. Let us
now return to Calvin at Paris.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A NEW WORLD&mdash;NEW LANGUAGES.</div>

<p>A new world opened before the young man in the metropolis
of letters. He profited by it, applied to his studies, and
made great progress in Latin literature. He became familiar
with Cicero, and learned from this great master to employ
the language of the Romans with a facility, purity, and
ease that excite the admiration even of his enemies. But at
the same time, he found riches in this language which he
afterwards transferred to his own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CALVIN'S INFLUENCE ON THE FRENCH LANGUAGE.</div>

<p>Up to this time Latin had been the only language of the
learned; and to our own days it has remained the language
of the Roman Church. The Reformation created or at least
emancipated the vulgar tongue. The exclusive office of the
priest had ceased; the people were called to learn and know
for themselves. In this one fact was involved the ruin of
the language of the priest, and the inauguration of the language
of the people. It is no longer to the Sorbonne alone,
to a few monks, or ecclesiastics, or literary men, that the
new ideas are to be addressed; but to the noble, the citizen,
and the labourer. All men are now to be preached to;
nay more, all are to become preachers&mdash;wool-combers and
knights, as well as doctors and parish-priests. A new language
is wanted, or at the least the language of the people
must undergo an immense transformation, a great enfranchisement,
and, drawn from the common uses of life, must
receive its patent of nobility from renovated Christianity.
The Gospel, so long slumbering, has awoke; it speaks and
addresses whole nations, everywhere kindling generous affections;
it opens the treasures of heaven to a generation
that was thinking only of the mean things on earth; it
shakes the masses; it talks to them of God, of man, of good
and evil, of the pope and the Bible, of a crown in heaven,
and perhaps a scaffold upon earth. The popular tongue,
which hitherto had been the language of chroniclers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
troubadours only, was called by the Reformation to act a new
part, and consequently to new developments. A new world
is opening upon society, and for a new world there must be
new languages. The Reformation removed the French from
the swaddling bands in which it had hitherto been bound,
and reared it to its majority. From that time the language
has had full possession of those exalted privileges that
belong to the operations of the mind and the treasures of
heaven, of which it had been deprived under the guardianship
of Rome. No doubt the language is formed by the
people themselves: they invent those happy words, those
energetic and figurative expressions, that impart to language
such colouring and life. But there are resources beyond their
reach, and which can only proceed from men of intellect.
Calvin, when called upon to discuss and to prove, enriched
his mother-tongue with modes of connexion and dependence,
with shadows, transitions, and dialectic forms, that it did not
as yet possess.</p>

<p>These elements were already beginning to ferment in the
head of the young student at the college of La Marche.
This lad, who was destined to exercise so powerful a mastery
over the human heart, was also to subjugate the language
he would have to use as his weapon. Protestant France
subsequently habituated itself to the French of Calvin, and
Protestant France comprehends the most cultivated portion
of the nation; from it issued those families of scholars
and dignified magistrates who exerted so powerful an influence
over the refinement of the people; out of it sprung the
Port Royal,<a name="FNanchor_1124_1124" id="FNanchor_1124_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> one of the greatest instruments that have ever
contributed to form the prose and even the poetry of France,
and who, after endeavouring to transfer to the Gallican
catholicism the doctrine and language of the Reformation,
failed in one of his projects, but succeeded in the other; for
Roman-catholic France was forced to go and learn of her Jansenist
and reformed adversaries how to wield those weapons
of language without which it cannot contend against them.<a name="FNanchor_1125_1125" id="FNanchor_1125_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PERSECUTIONS AND TERROR.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>While the future reformer of religion and language was
thus growing to maturity in the college of La Marche, everything
was in commotion around the young and serious scholar,
who took no part as yet in the great movements that
were agitating society. The flames that consumed the hermit
and Pavanne had spread terror through Paris. But the
persecutors were not satisfied; a system of terror was set on
foot throughout France. The friends of the Reformation no
longer dared correspond with one another, for fear their intercepted
letters should betray to the vengeance of the tribunals
both those who wrote them and those to whom they were
addressed.<a name="FNanchor_1126_1126" id="FNanchor_1126_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> One man, however, ventured to carry intelligence
from Paris and France to the refugees at Basle, by
sewing a letter that bore no signature under his doublet. He
escaped the squadrons of arquebusiers, the maréchaussée of
the several districts, the examinations of the provosts and
lieutenants, and reached Basle without the mysterious doublet
being searched. His tidings filled Toussaint and his
friends with alarm. "It is frightful," said Toussaint, "to
hear of the great cruelties there inflicted!"<a name="FNanchor_1127_1127" id="FNanchor_1127_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> Shortly before
this, two Franciscan monks had arrived at Basle, closely
pursued by the officers of justice. One of them named John
Prévost had preached at Meaux, and had afterwards been
thrown into prison at Paris.<a name="FNanchor_1128_1128" id="FNanchor_1128_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a> All that they told of Paris
and Lyons, through which they had passed, excited the compassion
of these refugees. "May our Lord send his grace
thither," wrote Toussaint to Farel; "I assure you that I am
sometimes in great anxiety and tribulation."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOPE AND LIBERTY.</div>

<p>These excellent men still kept up their courage; in vain
were all the parliaments on the watch; in vain did the spies
of the Sorbonne and of the monks creep into churches, colleges,
and even private families, to catch up any word of
evangelical doctrine that might there be uttered; in vain did
the king's soldiers arrest on the highways everything that
seemed to bear the stamp of the Reformation: those Frenchmen
whom Rome and her satellites were hunting down and
treading under foot, had faith in better days to come, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
already perceived afar off the end of this Babylonish captivity,
as they called it. "The seventieth year, the year of deliverance,
will come at last," said they, "and liberty of spirit and
of conscience will be given to us."<a name="FNanchor_1129_1129" id="FNanchor_1129_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a> But the seventy years
were destined to last nearly three centuries, and it was only
after calamities without a parallel that these hopes were to
be realized. It was not in man, however, that the refugees
placed any hope. "Those who have begun the dance," said
Toussaint, "will not stop on the road." But they believed
that the Lord "knew those whom he had chosen, and would
deliver his people with a mighty hand."<a name="FNanchor_1130_1130" id="FNanchor_1130_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a></p>

<p>The Chevalier d'Esch had in effect been delivered. Escaping
from the prison at Pont à Mousson, he had hastened to
Strasburg; but he did not remain there long. "For the
honour of God," immediately wrote Toussaint to Farel, "endeavour
to prevail on the knight, our worthy master,<a name="FNanchor_1131_1131" id="FNanchor_1131_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a> to
return as speedily as possible; for our brethren have great
need of such a leader?" In truth, the French refugees had
new cause of alarm. They trembled lest that dispute about
the Lord's Supper, which had so much distressed them in
Germany, should pass the Rhine, and cause fresh troubles in
France. Francis Lambert, the monk of Avignon, after
visiting Zurich and Wittemberg, had been in Metz; but
they did not place entire confidence in him; they feared lest
he should have imbibed Luther's sentiments, and that by
controversies, both useless and "monstrous" (as Toussaint
calls them), he might check the progress of the Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_1132_1132" id="FNanchor_1132_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a>
Esch therefore returned to Lorraine; but it was to be again
exposed to great dangers, "along with all those who were
seeking the glory of Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_1133_1133" id="FNanchor_1133_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TOUSSAINT AT PARIS&mdash;IMPRISONED.</div>

<p>Yet Toussaint was not of a disposition to send others to
the battle without joining in it himself. Deprived of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
daily intercourse with &OElig;colampadius, reduced to associate
with an ignorant priest, he had sought communion with
Christ, and felt his courage augmented. If he could not return
to Metz, might he not at least go to Paris? True, the
piles of Pavanne and the hermit of Livry were smoking still,
and seemed to repel from the capital all those who held the
same faith as they did. But if the colleges and the streets of
Paris were struck with terror, so that no one dared even name
the Gospel and the Reformation, was not that a reason why
he should go thither? Toussaint quitted Basle, and entered
those walls where fanaticism had taken the place of riot and
debauchery. While advancing in christian studies, he endeavoured
to form a connexion with those brethren who
were in the colleges, and especially in that of the Cardinal
Lemoine, where Lefevre and Farel had taught.<a name="FNanchor_1134_1134" id="FNanchor_1134_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a> But he
could not long do so freely. The tyranny of the parliamentary
commissioners and of the theologians reigned supreme
in the capital, and whoever displeased them was accused of
heresy.<a name="FNanchor_1135_1135" id="FNanchor_1135_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> A duke and an abbot, whose names are unknown
to us, denounced Toussaint as a heretic; and one day the
king's sergeants arrested the youth from Lorraine and put
him in prison. Separated from all his friends, and treated
like a criminal, Toussaint felt his wretchedness the more
keenly. "O Lord," exclaimed he, "withdraw not thou thy
Spirit from me! for without it I am but flesh and a sink of
iniquity." While his body was in chains, he turned in heart
to those who were still combating freely for the Gospel.
There was &OElig;colampadius, his father, and "whose work

must the names of all these men have softened the bitterness

he; "I know that they are a temptation of the

confession of his faith. "It is my glory," exclaimed he,
"to be called a heretic by those whose lives and doctrines
are opposed to Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_1144_1144" id="FNanchor_1144_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1144_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> And this interesting and
bold young man subscribed his letters, "Peter Toussaint,
unworthy to be called a Christian."</p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRMNESS AND COURAGE.</div>

<p>Thus, in the absence of the king, new blows were continually
aimed against the Reformation. Berquin, Toussaint,
and many others, were in prison; Schuch, Pavanne, and the
hermit of Livry, had been put to death; Farel, Lefevre, Roussel,
and many other defenders of the holy doctrine, were in exile;
the mouths of the mighty ones were dumb. The light of the
Gospel day was growing dim; the storm was roaring incessantly,
bending and shaking as if it would uproot the young
tree that the hand of God had so recently planted in France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PERSECUTION MORE VIGOROUS&mdash;DU BLET AND MOULIN.</div>

<p>Nor was this all. The humble victims who had already
fallen were to be succeeded by more illustrious martyrs.
The enemies of the Reform in France, having failed when
they began with persons of rank, had submitted to begin at
the bottom, but with the hope of rising gradually until they
procured the condemnation and death of the most exalted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
personages. The inverse progress succeeded with them.
Scarcely had the ashes with which the persecution had covered
the Grève and the avenues of Notre-Dame been dispersed by
the wind, before fresh attacks were commenced. Messire Anthony
Du Blet, that excellent man, the Lyons merchant, sunk
under the persecutions of these enemies of the truth, in company
with another disciple, Francis Moulin, of whose fate
no details have been handed down.<a name="FNanchor_1145_1145" id="FNanchor_1145_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> They went further
still; they now took a higher aim; there was an illustrious
person whom they could not reach, but whom they could
strike in those who were dear to her. This was the Duchess
of Alençon. Michael d'Arande, chaplain to the king's sister,
for whose sake Margaret had dismissed her other preachers,
and who proclaimed the pure doctrine of the Gospel in her
presence, became the object of attack, and was threatened
with imprisonment and death.<a name="FNanchor_1146_1146" id="FNanchor_1146_1146"></a><a href="#Footnote_1146_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a> About the same time
Anthony Papillon, for whom the princess had obtained the
office of chief master of requests to the Dauphin, died suddenly,
and the general report, even among the enemies, was
that he had been poisoned.<a name="FNanchor_1147_1147" id="FNanchor_1147_1147"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TERROR AND MOURNING.</div>

<p>Thus the persecution spread over the kingdom, and daily
drew nearer to the person of Margaret. After the forces of the
Reform, concentrated at Meaux, at Lyons, and at Basle, had
been dispersed, they brought down one after another those isolated
combatants who here and there stood up for it. Yet a
few more efforts, and the soil of France will be free from heresy.
Underhanded contrivances and secret practices took the place
of clamour and the stake. They will make war in open
day, but they will also carry it on in darkness. If fanaticism
employs the tribunal and the scaffold for the meaner sort,
poison and the dagger are in reserve for the great. The doctors
of a celebrated society have made too good a use of these
means, and even kings have fallen under the dagger of the
assassins. But justice demands that we should remember if
Rome has had in every age its fanatical assassins, it has also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
had men like Vincent de Paul and Fenelon. These blows
struck in darkness and silence were well adapted to spread
terror on every side.</p>

<p>To this perfidious policy and fanatical persecution from
within, were added the fatal reverses from without. A veil
of mourning hung over the whole nation. There was not a
family, particularly among the nobles, whose tears did not
flow for the loss of a father, a husband, or a son left on the
fields of Italy,<a name="FNanchor_1148_1148" id="FNanchor_1148_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> or whose hearts did not tremble for the liberty
and even the life of one of its members. The great reverses
that had fallen upon the nation diffused a leaven of hatred
against the heretics. People and parliament, church and
throne, joined hand in hand.</p>

<p>Was it not enough for the Duchess of Alençon that the
defeat of Pavia should have deprived her of a husband, and
made her brother a prisoner? Must the torch of the Gospel,
in whose mild light she so rejoiced, be extinguished perhaps
for ever? In May 1525, she had felt increase of sorrow.
Charles of Lannoy had received orders to take his prisoner
into Spain. Margaret had recourse to the consolations of
faith, and having found them, immediately communicated
them to her brother. "My lord," she wrote, "the farther
you are removed from us, the stronger is my hope of your
deliverance: for when the reason of man is troubled and
fails, then the Lord performs his mighty works.&mdash;And now,
if he makes you partaker of the pains he has borne for you,
I beseech you, my lord, to believe that it is only to try how
much you love him, and to afford you space to learn how
he loves you; for he will have your whole heart, as he
through love hath given his own. After having united you
to himself by tribulation, he will deliver you to his glory
and your consolation, by the merits of his victorious resurrection,
in order that by you his name may be known and
sanctified, not only in your kingdom, but in all Christendom,
until the conversion of the unbelievers. Oh! how blessed
will be your brief captivity, by which God will deliver so many
souls from unbelief and eternal condemnation!"<a name="FNanchor_1149_1149" id="FNanchor_1149_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> Francis I.
deceived the hopes of his pious sister.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOD PRESERVES THE CHURCH.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>The news from Spain soon increased the general sorrow.
Mortification and illness endangered the life of the haughty
Francis. If the king remains a prisoner, if he dies, if his
mother's regency is prolonged for many years, will not the
Reformation be crushed for ever? "But when all seems
lost," said the young scholar of Noyon at a later period,
"God saves his Church in a marvellous way."<a name="FNanchor_1150_1150" id="FNanchor_1150_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> The
Church of France, which was as if in the travail of birth, was
to have an interval of ease before her pains returned; and
to this end God made use of a weak woman, who never
openly declared in favour of the Reformation. At that time
she thought more of saving the king and the kingdom, than
of delivering obscure Christians, who nevertheless rested
great hopes in her.<a name="FNanchor_1151_1151" id="FNanchor_1151_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a> But under the splendour of worldly
affairs God often conceals the mysterious ways by which
he governs his people. A noble project arose in the mind of
the Duchess of Alençon. To cross the sea or the Pyrenees,
and rescue Francis from the power of Charles V., was now
the object of her life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARGARET'S PROJECT.</div>

<p>Margaret of Valois announced her intention, which was
suggested by her mother, and all France hailed it with shouts
of gratitude. Her great genius, the reputation she had acquired,
the love she felt for her brother, and that of Francis
towards her, were a great counterpoise in the eyes of Louisa
and Duprat to her attachment to the new doctrine. All eyes
were turned upon her, as the only person capable of extricating
the kingdom from its perilous position. Let Margaret
visit Spain, let her speak to the powerful emperor and to
his ministers, and let her employ that admirable genius
which Providence has bestowed on her, for the deliverance
of her brother and her king!</p>

<p>Yet very different sentiments filled the hearts of the nobles
and of the people, as they saw the Duchess of Alençon going
into the midst of the enemy's councils, and among the fierce
soldiery of the catholic king.</p>

<p>All admired the courage and devotion of this young
woman, but did not share it. The friends of the princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
had fears on her behalf, which were but too near being realized.
The evangelical Christians were full of hope. The
captivity of Francis I. had brought unheard-of severities
on the friends of the Reform; his liberation, they thought,
might bring them to an end. To open the gates of Spain
to the king, would be to close those of the prisons into
which the servants of the Word of God had been thrown.
Margaret encouraged herself in a project towards which all
her soul felt attracted by so many different motives:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Heaven's height cannot my passage stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor powers of hell can bar my way,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My Saviour holds the keys of both.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Her woman's heart was strengthened by that faith which
overcomes the world, and her resolution was irrevocable.
Every preparation was made for this important and dangerous
journey.</p>

<p>The Archbishop of Embrun, afterwards Cardinal of Tournon,
and the president Selves, were already at Madrid, treating
for the king's deliverance. They were placed under
Margaret's orders, as was also the Bishop of Tarbes, afterwards
Cardinal of Grammont; full powers being given to the
princess alone. At the same time Montmorency, afterwards
so hostile to the Reform, was sent in all haste to Spain to
procure a safe-conduct for the king's sister.<a name="FNanchor_1152_1152" id="FNanchor_1152_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a> The emperor
objected at first, and said that it was the duty of his ministers
alone to arrange this affair. "One hour's conference," exclaimed
Selves, "between your majesty, the king my master,
and the Duchess of Alençon, would forward the treaty more
than a month's discussion between diplomatists."<a name="FNanchor_1153_1153" id="FNanchor_1153_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MISSION AND SAFE-CONDUCT.</div>

<p>Margaret, impatient to arrive in consequence of the king's
illness, set off without a safe-conduct, accompanied by a
splendid train.<a name="FNanchor_1154_1154" id="FNanchor_1154_1154"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> She quitted the court, moving towards the
Mediterranean; but while she was on the road, Montmorency
returned with letters from Charles guaranteeing her liberty
for three months only. That matters not; she will not be
stopped. The eagerness for this journey was such that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
Duchess had been compelled to ask the king whom she should
select to accompany her. "Your good servants have so great
a desire to see you, that each one prays to be allowed to go
with me," she wrote to her brother.</p>

<p>Margaret had scarcely reached the shores of the Mediterranean
when the fears of those about her on the insufficiency of
the safe-conduct, but especially the bad weather and the tempest,
made her halt. "The seamen themselves (wrote she to
Montmorency) are alarmed." On the 27th August she made
up her mind. "The bearer," she wrote to the king on the very
day, "the bearer will tell you how the heavens, the sea, and
the opinions of men have retarded my departure. But He
alone to whom all things pay obedience, hath given such
favourable weather that every difficulty is solved......I will
not delay either on account of my own security or of the sea,
which is unsettled at this season, to hasten towards the
place where I may see you; for fear of death, imprisonment,
and every sort of evil are now so habitual to me, that I hold
lightly my life, health, glory, and honour, thinking by this
means to share your fortune, which I would desire to bear
alone."<a name="FNanchor_1155_1155" id="FNanchor_1155_1155"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a> Nothing therefore could detain this princess at
Aigues-Mortes,<a name="FNanchor_1156_1156" id="FNanchor_1156_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> and in this port Margaret embarked on
board the ship prepared for her. Led by Providence into
Spain, rather for the deliverance of humble and oppressed
Christians, than to free the mighty King of France from his
captivity, she confided herself to the waves of that sea which
had borne her brother a captive after the disastrous battle
of Pavia.</p>

182. This letter, placed in M. de Wette's collection, under the date of
April 14, must be posterior to the month of June; since on the 26th of
June Luther writes that Probst has been taken a second time and is
going to be burnt. We cannot admit that Probst visited Wittemberg
between his two imprisonments, for Luther would not have said of a
Christian, who had saved his life by a recantation, that he had been
delivered by a miracle of God. Perhaps we should read in the date of the
letter <i>in die S. Turiafi</i>, instead of <i>in die S. Tiburtii</i>, which would bring it
down to the 13th of July,&mdash;a far more probable date in my opinion.</p></div>

Tschudi, both enemies of the Reformation, quote a pretended letter of
Zwingle's, addressed about this time to Kolb at Berne. It is as follows:&mdash;
</p><blockquote><p>
"Health and blessing from God our Lord. Dear Francis, proceed
gently in the affair; at first throw the bear only one sour pear among
many sweet ones; then two, and afterwards three; and when he has begun
to eat them, throw him more and more&mdash;sour and sweet all together; at
last empty the sack entirely, hard and soft, sweet, sour, and unripe; he
will eat them all, and will no longer allow them to be taken away, or
himself to be driven from them.&mdash;Zurich, Monday before St. George's
day, 1525.
</p>

<p class="signature">
"Your servant in Christ, <span class="smcap">Ulrich Zwingle</span>."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
There are decisive reasons against the authenticity of this letter.&mdash;I.
In 1525, Kolb was pastor at Wertheimer; he did not remove to Berne
until 1527. (See Zw. Epp. p. 526.)&mdash;M. de Haller, indeed, very arbitrarily
substitutes 1527 for 1525: this correction was no doubt very
well meant; but here, unfortunately, Haller is at variance with Salat
and Tschudi, who, although they do not agree as to the day on which
this letter was alluded to in the diet, are unanimous as to the year, which
with both is clearly 1525.&mdash;II. There is a difference as to the manner in
which this letter was divulged; according to one version, it was intercepted;
according to another, some of Kolb's parishioners communicated
it to an inhabitant of the smaller cantons who chanced to be at Berne.&mdash;III.
The original is in German; but Zwingle always wrote in Latin to his
learned friends; and besides, he saluted them as their <i>brother</i>, and not as
their <i>servant</i>.&mdash;IV. If we read Zwingle's letters, we shall see that it is
impossible to find two styles more unlike than that of the pretended letter
and his. Zwingle would never have written a letter to say so little;
his epistles are generally long and full of news. To call the paltry jest
preserved by Salat <i>a letter</i>, is mere mockery.&mdash;V. As an historian Salat
deserves little confidence, and Tschudi appears to have copied him
with a few variations. It is possible that a man of the smaller cantons
may have had communication from some Bernese of Zwingle's letter to
Haller, which we have mentioned in our second volume (p. 359), where
Zwingle employs this same comparison of the bears with much dignity,
which moreover occurs in all the authors of that time. This may have
suggested to some wag the idea of inventing this spurious letter as addressed
by Zwingle to Kolb.</p></div>

Sebville, in which the following passage occurs: "Je te notifie que
l'évêque de Meaux en Brie près Paris, <i>cum Jacobo Fabro Stapulensi</i>, depuis
trois mois, en visitant l'évêché, ont brûlé actu toutes les images,
réservé le crucifix, et sont personellement ajournés à Paris, à ce mois de
Mars venant, pour répondre <i>coram supremâ curiâ et universitate</i>." I
am inclined to believe this fact authentic, although Sebville was not
on the spot, and that neither Mezeray, Daniel, nor Maimbourg allude
to it. These Romanist authors, who are very brief, might have had
reasons for passing it over in silence, considering the issue of the trial;
and Sebville's report agrees in other respects with all the known facts.
The matter is, however, doubtful.</p></div>

J. Levasseur, afterwards dean of the canons at Noyon, relates that when
Calvin's mother was in labour, "before the child was born, there came
forth a swarm of large flies, an indubitable presage that he would one
day be an evil speaker and a calumniator." Ann. de la Cath. de
Noyon, p. 1157. These absurdities and many others of the same kind
refute themselves, without our taking upon ourselves to do so. In our
days, those Romish doctors who are not ashamed to employ the weapons
of calumny, make a selection from these low and ridiculous stories, not
daring to cite them all; but they are all equally worthless.</p></div>
